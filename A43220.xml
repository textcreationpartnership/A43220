            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Cannot but admire to ſee moſt <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſo negligenn in their ſearch of Truth, ſo ſeemingly ſecure, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different in the buying and reading Controverſial Books, (which abound now a days more than ever) when yet in their Hearts they know they may be in <hi>Errour,</hi> for even by their <hi>own Principles</hi> they dare not ſo much as affirm they are <hi>Certainly</hi> in the right. The ſwarms of <hi>Books</hi> about <hi>Religion,</hi> that have theſe two laſt years fill'd the <hi>Preſs,</hi> render it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſile to ſay any thing New on this Occaſion, and therefore farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to write Controverſy, may ſeem vain and unneceſſary; and
<pb facs="tcp:103959:3"/>indeed, if all the <hi>Catholick</hi> Books that have been lately Publiſh'd, were read by the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> with the ſame Spirit of Humility with which they were wrote, all prejudice, paſſion, and intereſt, laid aſide, there would be abundantly enough to open the eyes of the people, and ſatisfie all diſcerning Men that <hi>Popery</hi> is not that Antichriſtian Monſter which it has for ſo many years been painted in <hi>England,</hi> but that it is indeed the true Antient <hi>Catholick</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolick Faith,</hi> which our Saviour deliver'd and taught his Apoſtles, and which has continued ſince, and been believed in the Church, in all ſucceeding Ages. But ſince we find too many ſtop their ears againſt all the charms of Truth, ſince we find ſtill ſuch mighty numbers of Men continue in entertaining their old bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous conceits of the <hi>Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:103959:3"/>and either through malice or negligence, very ſlow in Reading what might Inform their judgements, and ſettle their Conſciences, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be eſteemed improper for every honeſt Man to contribute his Mite, and endeavour what he may, to rouſe up ſome by a third or fourth call, who have refuſed the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; and for as much as many are diſcouraged by the length, and ſome by the dearneſs of the Book: I have reſolved to remove theſe two Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, an hours reading, with the expence of two pence, is all the time and the charge that needs be ſpent upon this Pamphlet.</p>
            <p>It must not be expected I ſhould launch out into thoſe prolix Diſputes that have almoſt at this day tir'd the Pens of Schoolmen; I intend only to eſtabliſh two or three moſt important Truths on which the <hi>Catholick Faith</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:103959:4"/>does more immediately depend. What I may beſide inſiſt on, ſhall only be in general, ſo as to give the <hi>Reader</hi> an occaſion of ſeeking elſewhere more particular Information, and that with as much brevity as Y can, or the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing will admit.</p>
            <p>I ſhall take the liberty to ſuppoſe (in as much as many <hi>Proteſtants</hi> own as much) that there has been in all Ages ſince our Saviour Chriſt plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Goſpel, a <hi>true Church</hi> on Earth, or to expreſs my ſelf more in the Proteſtant Phraſe, that there has been in every Age ſince Chriſt, a company of Men who have retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>Orthodox Faith</hi> deliver'd in the Goſpel: I dare not think there is a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> living will deny this, becauſe he would by ſo doing firſt maintain there was <hi>an Age</hi> ſince Chriſt, where in all the <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Creed</hi> were not <hi>true; viz.</hi> that
<pb facs="tcp:103959:4"/>there was no Holy <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> ſeconly, he would make Chriſt a falſe Prophet, who has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared <hi>he would never depart from his Church, but that he would be with her even unto the end of the World, and that the Gates of Hell ſhould not prevail againſt her.</hi> Matt. <hi>16.18.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will in the ſecond place make bold to ſuppoſe, that his true Church or this company of Orthodox Men has been viſible in all Ages: If there be a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> in the World, ſo weak, as to imagine the true Church was not viſible in all Ages, I deſire him to conſider, that ſo much is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in the very nature and eſſence of a Church, as to Preach the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> and adminiſter the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> (which even in his own notion are <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Signs</hi>) without which a <hi>Church</hi> can no more ſubſiſt than a <hi>Man</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="tcp:103959:5"/>a <hi>Head,</hi> or a <hi>Houſe</hi> without a <hi>Foundatian:</hi> And Secondly, ſeeing Preaching the <hi>Goſpel</hi> and Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring the <hi>Sacraments</hi> are Actiors, Viſible and Conſpicuous, the Church that does theſe things, muſt by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequence be <hi>Viſible</hi> and <hi>Conſpicuous</hi> likewiſe; there is no Sophiſtry in this, but what any one that pleaſes may reduce to a plain and eaſy Syllogiſm: And indeed, is there any thing in Nature more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and contradictory, than to affirm the <hi>true Church</hi> was at all times, and yet not at all times <hi>Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</hi> What the Church daily does, and what ſhe muſt of neceſſity do, to deſerve that name, are things as manifeſt and evident to humane ſenſe as teaching a <hi>School,</hi> or the Rule of a <hi>Commonwealth;</hi> and will any man affirm that a <hi>School</hi> can be Taught, or a <hi>State Governed</hi> in an <hi>inviſible</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:103959:5"/>Manner? Surely no; neither then may any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> be ſo abſurd, as to believe the Church of Chriſt was at any time Inviſible, and not rather Viſibly Apparent in her <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Sacraments,</hi> as well as in her <hi>Aſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emblies</hi> on thoſe occaſions.</p>
            <p>Taking it then for granted, that there has been a <hi>true Church</hi> at all times ſince Chriſt; and that <hi>this Church</hi> has been at all times viſible, it follows by an eaſie Conſequence, which every body can infer, that what ever Church is not able to prove her Being ſince Chriſt, and her being vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible all that time, cannot be the <hi>True Church:</hi> But neither the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor that of <hi>Luther</hi> or <hi>Calvin,</hi> nor any <hi>Proteſtant Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Church,</hi> have been <hi>Viſible</hi> in all Ages ſince Chriſt, therefore, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor any other <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Church is the <hi>True
<pb facs="tcp:103959:6"/>Church.</hi> I would fain ſee to this a plain and poſſitive anſwer given; 'tis what has not yet been given by any defender of the <hi>Proteſtant Cauſe,</hi> nor, I ſuppoſe, will ever be to the end of the World. How ridiculous is it, and how unbecoming any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Creature what <hi>Proteſtants</hi> urge in this matter, that their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were taught and believed in the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> till ſhe fell into Idolatry and Superſtition, where ſhe lay buried for above <hi>1000</hi> years, till God rais'd up <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> and the other Reformers, to remove the Errors, and raiſe up a new Glorious Orthodox <hi>Church.</hi> I have often admir'd how ſuch palpable Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and ſuch groſs Contradictions came to be propoſed, but much more how they ever came to be received in the World! For what can be more ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly Blaſphemous than to ſay God
<pb facs="tcp:103959:6"/>raiſed up Men to reſtore his <hi>Church,</hi> who yet could by no means Agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves in matters of Faith (as hereafter will appear) and whoſe Followers do at this day purſue each other with <hi>Excommunications</hi> and <hi>Anathema's?</hi> If <hi>Calvin</hi> was the Meſſenger of God, then was <hi>Luther</hi> a Sacrilegious Impoſtor; if the Church of <hi>England</hi> be <hi>Orthodox,</hi> then were <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> both Impoſtors; and if any other of the <hi>Reformers</hi> were in the right, the Church of <hi>England</hi> is in the wrong. Which then of the Diſſenting <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> Doctrin ſhall we ſay was the belief of the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church? Were all theſe at once the <hi>Primitive Faith.</hi> or was ſome one Denomination of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, the <hi>primitive Believers,</hi> and thoſe of all <hi>other Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations</hi> in the wrong It being impoſſible, as I have proved, that
<pb facs="tcp:103959:7"/>the True <hi>Faith</hi> ſhould ever be <hi>Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſble</hi> at any time; if therefore <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> had ever been profeſſed, it could never have been totally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd.</p>
            <p>Though moſt certain it is, that no footſteeps of any of the <hi>Reformers</hi> Principles were known for almoſt 1500 years in the <hi>Chriſtian World,</hi> except in ſome <hi>Hereſies</hi> condemned in ſeveral Ages of the <hi>Church,</hi> which do indeed much reſemble the Innovations of our Modern <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,</hi> as their Doctrine of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi> in the Hereſie of <hi>Berenga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius;</hi> of <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> in the Hereſie of <hi>Vigilantius;</hi> of <hi>Prayer for the Dead</hi> in <hi>Aerius;</hi> of <hi>Images,</hi> in <hi>Xenias</hi> and the <hi>Iconaclaſts;</hi> of <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> in the <hi>Novatianus;</hi> their practice of no <hi>mingled Chalice,</hi> in the Hereſie of the <hi>Armenians;</hi> and of <hi>Prieſts Marriages,</hi> in <hi>Jovinian;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:103959:7"/>as <hi>Luthers</hi> Marrying a <hi>Nun,</hi> borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Marcions</hi> corrupting a Virgin, and to add no more; their Famous Naggshead <hi>Conſecration</hi> copied from <hi>Novatus</hi> that was made a Biſhop in a <hi>Tavern,</hi> and depoſed by <hi>Cornelius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now for the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> ſhe muſt ever ſtand, or fall on her own Bottom, having ſo notoriouſly condemned all other parts of the <hi>Reformation:</hi> That the <hi>Lutherans</hi> are condemn'd by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> every body knows, and that the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> are ſo too, I will in one word plainly ſhew. A <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Parſon that comes from <hi>France,</hi> from <hi>Holland</hi> or <hi>Geneva,</hi> to be Beneficed in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> cannot be admitted to Preach, nor Adminiſter the Sacraments after the Rites of the <hi>Engliſh Church,</hi> till he has renounced that Miſſion he
<pb facs="tcp:103959:8"/>had before, and taken new Orders according to the form of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which to all Men of ſenſe implies, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> does aſſuredly believe the <hi>Calviniſt</hi> Teachers are falſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſters, that they have no <hi>Miſſion,</hi> no <hi>Authority,</hi> no <hi>Ordination,</hi> and by conſequence no <hi>Sacraments,</hi> being in their conceits purely <hi>Lay-men:</hi> From hence I take the liberty to ask the Doctors of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, how they can in honour and conſcience call them their <hi>Brethren</hi> (as they do) of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> from whom they have ſeperated at ſo great a diſtance, as to reject all their <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations</hi> at once as <hi>null</hi> and <hi>void,</hi> and how they can ſuffer the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch Hugonots</hi> to have Churches, and free exerciſe of their Religion here, and ſome of them alſo the Church of <hi>Englands Liturgy;</hi> at
<pb facs="tcp:103959:8"/>the ſame time, as they believe them neither to have <hi>Prieſthood</hi> nor <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,</hi> and by conſequence no ſuch thing as a Church at all? Seeing then the Church of <hi>England</hi> look on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as the <hi>only</hi> Church of the <hi>Refonmation;</hi> it follows, that ſhe muſt accordingly prove her ſelf the <hi>true</hi> Church, and ſhew how that Sum of Chriſtian <hi>Doctrin</hi> which ſhe now holds, has been conſtantly held in all paſt Ages of the Church, which I am ſure all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Doctors in the World will not make out; nay, I think they do not ſo much as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to: For to end all Controverſies, let them ſhew but one <hi>Service-Book,</hi> in all the <hi>1500</hi> years before <hi>Luther,</hi> in any one vulgar Tongue, which agreeth with their <hi>Service Book,</hi> and for that one Book ſake, we will ſubmit the cauſe; no, they ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, that for about <hi>1000</hi> years
<pb facs="tcp:103959:9"/>Popiſh Superſtition was the only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion known in the World: Which <hi>Superſtition</hi> as they call it) I ſhall now endeavour to prove to be that <hi>true Religion</hi> which has been from our Saviours time, and which muſt Infallibly laſt to the end of the World.</p>
            <p>The Arguments by which I have briefly, and I hope evidently ſhewn that the <hi>Proteſtant Church</hi> neither ſingle nor aggregate, can be the true <hi>Church,</hi> do at the ſame time as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently prove the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to be ſo. For as the <hi>Proteſtant Churches</hi> want of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> their not having been from the beginning of <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> nor <hi>Viſible</hi> till within <hi>200</hi> years, proves them not to be the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> ſo the Antiquity of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> her having been from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and continuing ſtill Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb facs="tcp:103959:9"/>by propagating the Goſpel, and Adminiſtring the <hi>Sacraments</hi> in all Ages ſince <hi>Chriſt,</hi> does as plainly evince <hi>her</hi> to be the only true <hi>Church,</hi> the ſpouſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and Pillar of <hi>Truth.</hi> I demand, has not <hi>this Church</hi> in all Ages had a <hi>viſible Succeſſion</hi> of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> a <hi>ſettled Government,</hi> with a viſible <hi>Head,</hi> from St. <hi>Peter</hi> to this very day? Has not this been the <hi>only Church</hi> that has duly planted the Faith, and as duly ſuppreſſed <hi>Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Schiſm?</hi> Is not this the Church that has held all <hi>General Councils,</hi> and has not the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided in the <hi>four Firſt,</hi> ſeemingly allowed of by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi> Is not this the only Church that has ſent <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Miſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries</hi> out to plant the <hi>Goſpel</hi> in all the <hi>Infidel corners</hi> of the Earth, and from whence <hi>England</hi> firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb facs="tcp:103959:10"/>the <hi>Chriſtian Faith?</hi> Is there any other Church that can pretend to have been aſſiſted by God Almighty in the working of <hi>Miracles,</hi> and in the Converſion of Nations? What other Church can ſhew an Army of <hi>Martyrs</hi> and <hi>Confeſſors,</hi> a number of Men that lead moſt Holy and Auſtere Lives, forſaking the World to follow Chriſt? What other Church in the World can pretend either to <hi>Unity</hi> or <hi>Univerſality</hi> to be every where the ſame, <hi>and</hi> to have all her Children at perfect Agreement in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Doctrine?</hi> (for the diſputes of <hi>Catholicks</hi> are about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>not defin'd,</hi> and ſo <hi>controverta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> but never about a Doctrine that has been once determined in a <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council</hi>) Theſe are the Marks and eſſential ones of the <hi>true</hi> Church, but theſe agree to no other Church but that of <hi>Rome;</hi> the Church of
<pb facs="tcp:103959:10"/>
               <hi>Rome</hi> is therefore the only Church. Whatever the <hi>Grecian</hi> or the <hi>Abyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſine</hi> Churches have to ſay in anſwer to this, (which does not much concern us) ſure I am the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> has nothing plauſible to excuſe her Schiſm and Rebellion againſt her Mother <hi>Church,</hi> and under whoſe ſubjection ſhe has been bred and maintained for many Ages in the World. Every one knows, (and no <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> Man can deny) that this National <hi>Church</hi> was in all Ages ſubject to, and a part of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Church, and that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is Patriarch, of the <hi>Weſt</hi> is acknowledged by King <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>T.

I hope the old way of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering will be no more taken up by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants to confute this or any Paper of the ſame Nature: For when they can find no Reaſons nor Arguments that may paſs with Diſcerning Men to juſtifie the defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, or ſatisfie the people that the <hi>Roman</hi> is not the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church,</hi> they ſtill fly from the point in hand into Harangues and Rhetorical Digreſſions, falling foul on ſome Doctrine of the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour with <hi>Tropes</hi> and <hi>figures</hi> to paint out in the colours of Idolatry and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition.

               <p>WIth all humble ſubmiſſion of my whole Diſcourſe to your Wiſdoms, I purpoſe to ſpeak to the Body of this <hi>Act,</hi> touching the <hi>Supremacy;</hi> that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103959:14"/>ſo, what this Honourable Aſſembly is now adoing, concerning the paſſing of this <hi>Act,</hi> may thereby be better weighed, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by your Wiſdoms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> When by the Virtue of this <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> we muſt forſake and fly from the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> it would be conſidered, what matter lies therein; and what mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of danger, or inconvenience; or elſe, whether there be none at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the intent of this <hi>Act</hi> be to grant, or ſettle upon the <hi>Queens</hi> Majeſty a <hi>Supremacy;</hi> it would be conſidered of your Wiſdoms, what this <hi>Supremacy</hi> is, and whether it doth conſiſt in <hi>Spiritual</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or <hi>Temporal?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If in <hi>Temporal;</hi> what further Authority can this Houſe give Her, more than what She already hath by right of Inheritance? And not by your Gift, but by the Appointment of God: Being our Sovereign <hi>Lord</hi> and Lady; our <hi>King,</hi> and Queen; our <hi>Empreſs,</hi> and Emperour: And if further than this, we acknowledge Her to be <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> we ought alſo to grant, that the Emperour, or any other Prince, being Catholick, and their Subjects Proteſtants, <hi>are to be Heads of their Church:</hi> Whereby we ſhall do an Act, as diſagreeble to the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as this ſeems to <hi>Catholicks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you ſay, The <hi>Supremacy</hi> conſiſts in <hi>Spiritual</hi> concernments.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:103959:14"/>
               <p> Then, it would be conſidered, what the <hi>Spiritual Government</hi> is? and in what points it doth chiefly conſiſt: Which being firſt agreed upon, it would be further conſidered of your Wiſdoms, whether this Houſe may grant it to her Highneſs, or not? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her Highneſs be an apt Perſon to receive the ſame?</p>
               <p>So by through Examination of theſe parts, your Honours ſhall proceed in this matter groundedly, upon ſuch ſure know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as not to be deceived by ignorance.</p>
               <p>Now to the Firſt Point, wherein I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to examine, what matter of weight, danger, or inconvenience might be incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by this our forſaking, and flying from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> if there were no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter therein, than the with drawing our Obedience from the <hi>Popes Perſon,</hi> (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, that he had declar'd himſelf to be a very Auſtere and Severe Father to us) then the buſineſs were not of ſo great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as indeed it is, as will immediately here appear.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>For, by relinquiſhing and forſaking the Church, or See of <hi>Rome,</hi> we muſt forſake and fly from all General Councils.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, from all Canonical and Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Laws of the Church of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, From the Judgement of all other Chriſtian Princes.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, and Laſtly, we muſt forſake and fly from the Holy Unity of Chriſt's
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103959:15"/>Church; and ſo by leaping out of <hi>Peter's</hi> Ship, we hazard our ſelves to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed in the waves of Schiſm, of Sects, and Diviſions.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Firſt, Touching the General Councils, I ſhall name unto you theſe Four: The <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi> Council, the <hi>Conſtantinopolitan</hi> Council, the <hi>Epheſine,</hi> and the <hi>Chalcedon:</hi> All which are approved by all Men.</p>
               <p>Of theſe ſame Councils, <hi>Saint Gregory</hi> writes in this wiſe; <hi>Sicut enim Sancti Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelii quatuor Libros, ſic haec quatuor Conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> Nicenum, Conſtantinopolitanum, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſium, <hi>&amp;</hi> Chalcedonenſe, <hi>ſuſcipire, ac venerari me fateor:</hi> That is to ſay in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, <q>I confeſs, I do receive, and reverence thoſe Four General Councils, of <hi>Nice, Conſtantinople, &amp;c.</hi> even as I do the Four Holy Evangeliſts.</q>
               </p>
               <p>At the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, the firſt of the Four, the Biſhops which were there Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, did write there Epiſtles to <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> 
                  <q>That their decrees then made, might be confirmed by his Authority.</q>
               </p>
               <p>At the Council kept at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> all the Biſhops there, were obedient to <hi>Damaſus,</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> He, as cheif in the Council, gave Sentence againſt the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, <hi>Macedoneus, Sabillius,</hi> and <hi>Eunomius:</hi> Which <hi>Eunomius</hi> was both an <hi>Arrian,</hi> and the firſt Author of that Hereſie, <hi>That only Faith doth juctifie.</hi> And here (by the way)
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103959:15"/>it is much to be lamented, that we, the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of this Realm are much more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to raiſe up the Errors and Sects of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient condemned Hereticks, than to follow the True Approved Doctrine of the moſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick and Learned Fathers of Chriſt's-Church.</p>
               <p>At the <hi>Epheſine</hi> Council, <hi>Neſtorius</hi> the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick was condemned by <hi>Celeſtine</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> he being chief Judge there.</p>
               <p>At the <hi>Chalcedon</hi> Council, all the Biſhops there Aſſembled, did write their humble Submiſſion unto <hi>Leo,</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> wherein they did acknowledge him there to be their <hi>Chief Head:</hi> Six Hundred and Thirty Biſhops of them.</p>
               <p>Therefore to deny the See Apoſtolick, and its Authority, were to contemn and ſet at nought the Authority and Decrees of thoſe noble Councils.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We muſt forſake and fly from all Canonical and Eccleſiaſtical Laws of Chriſt his Church; whereunto we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready profeſſed our Obedience at <hi>the Font,</hi> ſaying <hi>Credo Sanctum Eccleſiam Catholicam;</hi> that is <hi>I believe in the Holy Catholick Church:</hi> Which Article contains, That we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Doctrine, and Sacraments of the ſame Church, obey her Laws, and live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſame: Which Laws do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend wholly upon the Authority of the <hi>See Apoſtolick.</hi> And like as it is there openly profeſſed by the Judges of the Realm, that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103959:16"/>the Laws agreed upon in the Higher and Lower Houſes of this Honourable Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, be of ſmall, or none effect, before the Royal Aſſent of the King, or Prince be given thereunto: Even ſo Eccleſiaſtical Laws made, cannot bind the Univerſal Church of Chriſt, without the Royal Aſſent, and Confirmation of the <hi>See Apostolick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, We muſt forſake and fly from the Judgement of all other Chriſtian Princes, whether they be Proteſtant or Catholick Chriſtians, when none of them do agree with theſe our doings: King <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. being the firſt that ever took upon him the Title of <hi>Supremacy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas it was of late, here in this Houſe, ſaid, by a Nobleman, That the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> is of right due to a King, for that he is a King; then would it follow, That <hi>Herod</hi> being a King, ſhould be Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Head of the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> And <hi>Nero</hi> the Emperour, Supream Head of the Church of Chriſt at <hi>Rome;</hi> they being both Infidels, and therefore no members of Chriſt's Church.</p>
               <p>And if our Saviour Chriſt, at his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from this World, ſhould have left the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Government of his Church in the hands of Emperours, and Kings, and not to have committed the ſame to his Apoſtles, how negligently then ſhould he have left his Church!</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:103959:16"/>
               <p> It ſhall appear right-well, by calling to mind, That the Emperour <hi>Conſtantinus Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> was the Firſt <hi>Christian Emperour,</hi> and was Baptized by <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> about Three hundred years after the <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If by your Propoſition, <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> the firſt Chriſtian Emperor was the <hi>Firſt Head,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Governor</hi> of Chriſts-Church, throughout his Empire; then it follows, That our Saviour Chriſt, for the ſpace of Three Hundred years, unto the coming of this <hi>Constantine,</hi> left his Church (which he had ſo dearly bought by effuſion of his moſt precious Blood) without any Head at all.</p>
               <p>But how untrue the ſaying of this Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was, it ſhall further appear by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Ozia,</hi> and alſo of King <hi>David.</hi> For King <hi>Ozia,</hi> did take the <hi>Cenſor</hi> to do In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe to the Altar of God. The Prieſt <hi>Aza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> did reſiſt him, and expelled him out of the Temple, and ſaid unto him. <hi>Non est Officii tui,</hi> Ozia, <hi>ut adoleas Incenſum Domino; ſed eſt Sacerdotam, &amp; Filiorum</hi> Aaron: <hi>Ad hujuſmodi enim Officium conſecrati.</hi> That is to ſay, <q>It is not thy Office, <hi>Ozia,</hi> to offer Incenſe to the Altar of God. But it is the Prieſts Office, and the Sons of <hi>Aaron;</hi> for they are Conſecrated, and Anointed to that Office.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now I ſhall moſt humbly demand this queſtion; When the Prieſt <hi>Azarius</hi> ſaid to the King, <hi>Non eſt Officii tui;</hi> whether he
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103959:17"/>ſaid Truth, or not? If you anſwer, that he ſpake the Truth, then the King was not Supream Head of the Church of the <hi>Jews.</hi> If you ſhall ſay, No: Why did God plague the King with Leproſie, and not the Prieſt?</p>
               <p>The Prieſt, <hi>Azarias,</hi> in reſiſting the King, and thruſting him out of the Temple; in ſo doing, did the Prieſt play the faithful part of a Subject, or no? if you anſwer No; why then did God ſpare the Prieſt, and not ſpare the King? If you anſwer, Yea; then it is moſt manifeſt, <hi>Ozia,</hi> in that he was a King, could not be Supream Head of the Church.</p>
               <p>And therefore King <hi>David</hi> did go before the Ark of God with his Harp, making Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody; and placed himſelf amongſt the Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrels, and humbly did abaſe himſelf, (being a King) as to dance and leap before the Ark of God; like as his other Subjects did: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, as his Queen <hi>Michol,</hi> King <hi>Saul</hi>'s Daughter, beholding and ſeeing this great Humility of King <hi>David,</hi> did diſdain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at. Whereunto King <hi>David,</hi> making an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, ſaid <hi>Ludam, &amp; vilior ſiam plùs quàm factus ſûm, &amp;c.</hi> That is, <q>I will dance, and abaſe my ſelf, more than yet I have done; and abjecting my ſelf in mine own eyes, I ſhall appear more glorious with thoſe Handmaids, that you talk of I will play here before my Lord; which hath choſen me, rather than thy Fathers Houſe.</q> And whereas, Queen <hi>Michol</hi> was therefore
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103959:17"/>plagued at God's hand, with perpetual Sterility and Barrenneſs, King <hi>David</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a great praiſe for his Humility.</p>
               <p>Now may it pleaſe your Honours, to conſider which of both theſe Kings Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſhall be moſt convenient for your Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, to make the Queens Majeſty to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; whether the Example of Proud <hi>Ozia;</hi> moving Her, by your perſwaſions and Councils, to take upon her spiritual Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and thereby expoſing her Soul to be plagued at the hand of God, as King <hi>Ozia</hi> was: or elſe to follow the Example of the good King <hi>David,</hi> which, in refuſal of all Spiritual Government about the Ark of God, did humble himſelf, as I have declared unto you.</p>
               <p>Whereunto our Sovereign Lady, the <hi>Queens</hi> Highneſs, of Her own nature being well inclined; we may aſſure ourſelves, to have of Her as Humble, as Virtuous, and as Godly a Miſtreſs to Reign over us, as ever had <hi>Engliſh</hi> People here in this Realm; if that her Highneſs be not by your Flattery, and Diſſimulation, ſeduced and beguiled.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, and Laſtly, We muſt forſake, and fly from the Holy Unity of Chriſt's-Church. Seeing that St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> that Holy Martyr, and great Clerk, doth ſay, that the Unity of the Church of Chriſt doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon <hi>Peter's Authority,</hi> and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors. Therefore by leaping out of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Ship, we muſt be overwhelmed with the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103959:18"/>Waves of Schiſms, of Sects and Diviſions: Becauſe the ſame Holy Martyr in his Third Epiſtle to <hi>Cornelius</hi> teſtifies, <hi>That all Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, Sects, and Schiſms, do ſpring only from hence, that Men will not be obedient to the Head Biſhop of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And how true this ſaying of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> is, we may ſee it moſt apparent to all Men that liſt to ſee, both by the Example of the <hi>Germans,</hi> and by us, the Inhabitants of this Realm of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And by this our forſaking, and flying from the Unity of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> this inconveniency amongſt many, we muſt grant the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the True Church of God, where Jeſus Chriſt is truly taught, and his Sacraments rightly Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred; how can we disburthen our ſelves of our forſaking, and flying from that Church, which we do confeſs, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be of God, we ought to be <hi>One,</hi> and not to admit of any <hi>Separation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you Anſwer, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not of God, but a Malignant Church; then it will follow, that we the Inhabitants of this Realm have not as yet received any Benefit of Chriſt; ſeeing we have received no Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, or other Doctrine, nor no other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that which was ſent unto us from he Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, in King <hi>Lucius</hi> his days, at whoſe humble Epiſtle the Holy Martyr <hi>Elutherius,</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> did ſend into this
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103959:18"/>Realm two Holy Monks, <hi>Fugatius,</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianus;</hi> by whoſe Doctrine and Preaching, we were firſt brought to the knowledge of the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, of his Holy Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and his moſt Holy Sacraments.</p>
               <p>Then Secondly, Holy St. <hi>Gregory</hi> being Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> did ſend into this Realm two other Holy Monks, St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> called the Apoſtle of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Milletus,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the very ſelf ſame Faith that had been before planted here in this Realm, in the days of King <hi>Lucius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, and Laſt of all, <hi>Paulus Tertius</hi> being Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> did ſend hither the Lord Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> his Grace, (by Birth a Nobleman of this Land) his Legate, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore us unto the ſame Faith which the Martyr, St. <hi>Elutherius</hi> and St. <hi>Gregory</hi> had Planted here many years before.</p>
               <p>If therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be not of God, but a falſe and Malignant Church, then have we been deceived all this while; ſeeing the Goſpel, the Doctrine Faith, and Sacraments, muſt be of the ſame nature as that Church is, from whence it, and they came; and therefore in relinquiſhing, and forſaking that Church, the Inhabitants of this Realm ſhall be forced to ſeek further for another Goſpel of Chriſt, other Doctrine, other Faith and Sacraments than we have hitherto received: Which will breed ſuch a Schiſm, and Error in Faith, as was never in any Chriſtian Realm. And therefore of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103959:19"/>your Wiſdoms worthy of Conſideration, and maturely to be ponder'd, and be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, before you paſs this Act of <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy.</hi> Thus much touching the Firſt chief Point.</p>
               <p>Now to the Second Deliberation, wherein I promiſed to move your Honours, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, What this <hi>Supremacy</hi> is, which we go about, by vertue of this Act, to give unto the <hi>Queen,</hi> and wherein it doth conſiſt; whether in <hi>Spiritual</hi> Government, or <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral.</hi> But if <hi>Spiritual,</hi> (as theſe words in the Act do import, <hi>Supream Head of the Church of England, immediately and next unto God;</hi>) Then it would be conſidered, in what Points this <hi>Spiritual</hi> Government doth conſiſt? and the Points being well known, it would be conſidered, Whether this Houſe hath <hi>Authority</hi> to grant them, and her Highneſs <hi>Ability</hi> to receive them.</p>
               <p>And as concerning the Points, <hi>wherein Spiritual Government doth conſiſt,</hi> I have, in reading the Goſpel, and the whole courſe of Divinity thereupon (as to my Vocation belongeth) obſerved theſe Four, as chief among many others: whereof the firſt is, The power to looſe and bind ſins. When our Saviour, in ordaining <hi>Peter</hi> to be Chief, and Head-Governour of his Church, ſaid unto him, <hi>Tibi dabo Claves Regni Coelorum, &amp;c.</hi> That is, <hi>To thee will I give the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. Now it would be conſidered by your Wiſdoms, whether
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103959:19"/>you have ſufficient Authority to grant unto her Majeſty this firſt Point of <hi>Spiritual</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and to ſay unto Her, <hi>Tibi dabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, &amp;c.</hi> To <hi>Thee will we give the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> If you ſay Yea, then do we require the ſight of Warrant and Commiſſion, by the Virtue of God's Word. And if you ſay No: then you may be well aſſured, and perſuade your ſelves, that you have not ſufficient Authority to make her Highneſs <hi>Supream Head of the Church of Chriſt</hi> here in this Realm.</p>
               <p>The Second Point of <hi>Spiritual Government</hi> is gathered out of theſe words of our Saviour Chriſt, ſpoken to <hi>St. Peter</hi> in the 20th. Chapter of <hi>St. John</hi>'s Goſpel, <hi>Paſce,—&amp; Paſce—&amp; Paſce,</hi> That is, <hi>Feed my Lambs, feed my Lambs, feed my Sheep:</hi> Now, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your Honours have Authority by this Court of Parliament, to ſay unto our <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Lady, Paſce, &amp; Paſce, &amp;c.</hi> That is to ſay, <hi>Feed you the flock of Chriſt,</hi> you muſt ſhew your Warrant and Commiſſion for it. An further it is evident, that Her Majeſty, being a Woman by Birth and Nature, is not qualified by Gods word, to feed the Flock of Chriſt, appears moſt plainly by <hi>St. Paul,</hi> in this wiſe, <hi>Taceant Mulieres in Eccleſus, ſicut &amp; lex dicit. Let Women be ſilent in the Church;</hi> for <hi>it is not Lawful for them to ſpeak,</hi> but <hi>to be in ſubjection,</hi> as <hi>the Law ſaith.</hi> And it followeth in the ſame place. <hi>Turpe eſt enim, Mulieris loqui in Eccleſiâ,</hi> that is, for
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103959:20"/>
                  <hi>that it is not ſeemly for a Woman to ſpeak in the Church.</hi> And in his Second Epiſtle to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy, Dominari in virum, ſed eſſe ſilentes;</hi> that is to ſay, I allow not that a Woman be a Teacher, or to be above her Husband, but to keep her ſelf in ſilence. Therefore it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears likewiſe, as your Honours have not Authority to give her Highneſs this ſecond Point of <hi>Spiritual</hi> Government, to feed the Flock of Chriſt: So by St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine, her Higneſs may not intermeddle her ſelf with the ſame. And therefore She cannot be <hi>Supream Head of the Church, here</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Third chief Point of <hi>Spiritual</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is gathered out of thoſe words of our Saviour Chriſt, ſpoken to <hi>St. Peter</hi> in the <hi>22th.</hi> Chapter of <hi>St. Lukes</hi> Goſpel. <hi>Ego ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gavi pro To, ut non deficiat fides Tua; &amp; Tu aliquando converſus, confirma fratres Tuos.</hi> That is, <hi>I Prayed for Thee, that thy Faith ſhall not fail; and thou being converted, Confirm thy Brethren,</hi> and ratifie them in wholeſome Doctrine, and Adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are the Holy Inſtruments of God ſo Inſtituted and Ordained for our Sanctification; that without them his Grace is not to be received. But to Preach, or to adminiſter the Sacraments, a Woman may not be admitted to do; neither may ſhe be <hi>Supream</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Church.</p>
               <p>The Fourth and Laſt chief point of <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Government,</hi> which I promiſed to Note
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103959:20"/>unto you, doth conſiſt in <hi>Excommunication,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Puniſhment</hi> of all ſuch, as ſhall approve themſelves, not to be the Obedient Children of Chriſt's Church.</p>
               <p>Of which Authority our Saviour Chriſt ſpeaks in St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Goſpel, in the 18th. Chapter, ſaying, <q>If your Brother offending will not hear your charitable admonition, whether ſecretly at firſt, or yet before one, or two Witneſſes, then we muſt complain of him to the Church,</q> and <hi>If he will not hear the Church, let him be taken as an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then or Publican.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the Apoſtle did <hi>Excommunicate</hi> the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious <hi>Fornicator,</hi> that was amongſt the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> and by the Authority of his Apoſtleſhip; unto which Apoſtles, Chriſt Aſcending into Heaven, did leave the whole <hi>Spiritual</hi> Government of his Church, as it appears by thoſe plain words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> Chap. 4th. ſaying, <hi>Ipſe dedit Eccleſiae ſuae,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He hath given to his Church, ſome to be Apoſtles, ſome Evangeliſts, ſome Paſtors and Doctors,</hi> for <hi>conſummation of the Saints, to the work of the Miniſtry,</hi> for <hi>edifying of the Body of Chriſt.</hi> But a Woman in the degrees of the Church, is not called to be an Apoſtle, nor Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt; nor to be a Paſtor (as much to ſay, a Shepheard) nor a Doctor, or a Preacher. Therefore ſhe cannot be <hi>Supream Head</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Militant</hi> Church; nor yet of any part thereof. For this high Government,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103959:21"/>God hath appointed only to the Biſhops, and Paſtors of his People; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> plainly witneſſeth in theſe words, in the 20th. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> ſaying, <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendite vohis, &amp; univerſo gregi, &amp;c.</hi> And thus much I have here ſaid, right Honourable, and my very good Lords, againſt this Act of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> for the diſcharge of my poor Conſcience, and for the Love, and Fear, and Dread, that I chiefly owe unto God, to my Sovereign Lord and Lady the Queens Majeſties Highneſs, and to your Honors All. Where otherwiſe, without mature conſideration of all theſe Premiſes, your Honors ſhall never be able to ſhew your faces before your enemies, in this matter; being ſo ſtrange a ſpectacle and example in Chriſt's Church, as in this Realm is only to be found, and in no other Chriſtan Realm.</p>
               <p>Thus humbly beſeeching your Honors, to take in good part, this my rude and plain <hi>Speech,</hi> which here I have uſed, out of much Zeal and fervent good will: And now I ſhall not trouble your <hi>Honors</hi> any longer. <hi>Thus at to this Speech.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding this <hi>Speech,</hi> or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever elſe could be ſaid againſt it, the Act paſſed, and this Supremacy was granted to the Queen.</p>

               <p>In the <hi>Litany</hi> firſt made and publiſhed by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the two <hi>Liturgies</hi> of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, there was a Prayer to the deliver'd from the <hi>Tyranny, and all the detestable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormities of the Biſhop of</hi> Rome: which was thought fit to be left out, as giving matter of Scandal and diſſatisfaction to all that Party.</p>
               <p>In the firſt <hi>Liturgy</hi> of King <hi>Edward,</hi> the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of our <hi>Lord's Body</hi> was deliver'd

The Blood of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. Which being thought by <hi>Calvin,</hi> and his Diſciples, to give ſome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to the Carnal preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament (which paſs'd by the name of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> in the Schools of <hi>Rome</hi>) was altered into this Form into the ſecond Liturgy; that is to ſay. <hi>Take and Eat this in remembrance that Chriſt died for thee, and feed on him in thy Heart by Faith, with Thanksgiving take and drink this,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>By which compliances, and the expung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the paſſages before mentioned, the Book was made more plauſible: And that it might paſs the better in both Houſes, when it came to the Vote, it was thought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, That a Diſputation ſhould be held about ſome Points, which were moſt likely to be keked at.</p>
               <p>Two speeches were made againſt this Book in the Houſe of Peers by <hi>Scot</hi> and <hi>Feckenham;</hi> and one againſt the Queens Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, by the Archbiſhop of <hi>York:</hi> But they prevail'd little in both Points by the Power of their Eloquence.</p>
               <p>In the Convocation, which accompained this preſent Parliament, there was little done; becauſe they deſpaired of doing any good to Themſelves or their Cauſe.</p>
               <p>The chief thing they did, was a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their Judgments in ſome certain
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103959:23"/>Points: Which at that time were conceiv'd fit to be commended to the ſight of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; that is to ſay,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the Sacrament of the Altar, by vertue of Chriſt's Aſſiſtance, after the words of Conſecration are duly pronounced by the Prieſt, the Natural Body of Chriſt, conceiv'd of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> is <hi>really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> under the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Bread and Wine. As alſo his Natural Blood.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That after the Conſecration, there remains not the Subſtance of Bread and Wine; nor any Subſtance, but the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of God and Man.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That the true Body of Chriſt, and his Blood, is offer'd for a Propitiatory Sacrifice for the Quick, and Dead.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That the Supream Power of Feeding, and Governing the Militant Church of Chriſt, and of Confirming their Brethren, is given to <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle, and to his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Succeſſors in the See Apoſtolick, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Vicar of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That the Authority to handle and define ſuch things, as belong to Faith, the Sacraments, and Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, hath hitherto ever belonged, and only ought to belong unto the Paſtors of the Church, whom the Holy Spirit hath placed in the Church; and not unto Lay-men.</p>
               <p>Theſe Articles they cauſed to be En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed; and ſo commended them to the Care and Conſideration of the Higher Houſe;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103959:24"/>preſented by <hi>Boner,</hi> to the Hands of the Lord Keeper <hi>Bacon;</hi> by whom they were candidly receiv'd.</p>
               <p>But they prevail'd no further with the Queen, or Houſe of Peers, when imparted to them, than that (poſſibly) they might help forwards the afore-mention'd Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>It was on the four and twentieth of <hi>June,</hi> that the Publick Liturgy was to be officia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in all the Churches of the Kingdom. In the performance of which ſervice, the Biſhops giving no encouragement, and many of the Clergy being backward in it, it was thought fit to put them to a Final <hi>Jeſt;</hi> and either to bring them to Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, or to beſtow their Places and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, on more tractable Perſons.</p>
               <p>The Biſhops at that time, were reduced into a narrow number, than at any other time before; there being no more than fifteen of that ſacred Order left.</p>
               <p>Theſe, being call'd by certain of the Lords of the Council, were requir'd to take the Oath of <hi>Supremacy. Kitchen,</hi> of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daff,</hi> only takes it: Who having formerly ſubmitted to every Change, resolv'd to ſhew himſelf no <hi>Changling,</hi> in not conforming to the pleaſures of the Higher Powers.</p>
               <p>By all the reſt it was refus'd</p>
               <p>Whereupon they were depriv'd of their Biſhopricks. The Biſhops being thus put out, the Oath is tendred next to the Deans,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103959:24"/>and Chapters; and laſtly to the rural Clergy, <hi>Thus Dr.</hi> Heylyn.</p>
               <p>It is here to be noted, That during the fore-mentioned <hi>Convocation,</hi> there came from both the Univerſities, a Writing ſign'd by a publick Notary; by which they both ſignified their concurrence to the aforeſaid Articles, only with a little alteration of the laſt.</p>
               <p>But theſe Declarations, and Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the whole Repreſentative <hi>Clergy,</hi> and <hi>Univerſities,</hi> were not like to ſignifie much, ſince a Change of Religion was abſolutely reſolv'd on.</p>

               <head>An account of the Years, in which theſe Changes in Religion were made.</head>
               <p>IN her Firſt year, ſhe being reſolv'd upon an Alteration of Religion (as knowing well, that her Legitimation, and the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Supremacy, could not ſtand together) cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Parliament, which totally complied with her Deſigns, in order to ſuch a Change. But the Convocation of the Clergy, which accompanied this Parliament, totally op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd it: And thereupon were depriv'd of their Eccleſiastical Benefices; a company of Ignorant and Illiterate Men, being Subſtituted in their places: Which gave occaſion to the <hi>Calvinists,</hi> or <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> to obtain great Eccleſiaſtical Preferments here: By
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103959:25"/>which they have continually laboured to ſupplant and undermine the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was the Second year of her Reign, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Biſhops were elected. The main cauſe, for keeping the Epiſcopal Sees ſo long vacant, was, that in the mean time, the beſt Flowers might be culled out of them. Aid this year was ſent to aſſiſt the Rebels in <hi>Scotland</hi> againſt their Lawful Queen. The <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> ſeeing Epiſcopal Government ſettled, begin to play their Game.</p>
               <p>The Biſhops being thus ſettled, begin the next year, to make Laws and to compoſe Articles of Religion, and to exact a Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to them: Upon which they find great oppoſition from the <hi>Presbyterians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In her fourth year, ſhe was ſolicited by Pope <hi>Pius,</hi> to ſend her Orators, to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent;</hi> which ſhe refus'd to do. The Emperour alſo writ to her to deſiſt from theſe Alterations of Religion, and to return to the Antient Catholick Faith of her Predeceſſors.</p>
               <p>In her fifth year, the Articles of Religion were agreed on in the Convocation.</p>
               <p>In her ſixth year, ſhe would have Married the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> to the Queen of <hi>Scots. Calvin</hi> dies this year, and <hi>Cartwright</hi> the great promoter of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> retires out of <hi>England,</hi> upon a diſcontent to <hi>Geneva.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In her ſeventh year, the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> began firſt to be called <hi>Puritans.</hi>

               <p>In her eighth year, the Government of the Church, by Archbiſhops, and Biſhops, was Confirm'd. And for this we are behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Boner,</hi> the late Biſhop of <hi>London:</hi> Who being call'd up to take the Oath of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> by <hi>Horn</hi> of <hi>Winton,</hi> refus'd to take the Oath, upon this account, becauſe <hi>Horn</hi>'s Conſecration was not good and valid by the Laws of the Land.</p>

               <p>In her Eleventh year, there aroſe a Sect, openly condemning the receiv'd Diſcipline
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:103959:26"/>of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> together with the Church Liturgy, and the very Calling of Biſhops.</p>
               <p>This Sect ſo mightily encreas'd; that in the Sixteenth year of her Reign, the Queen, and Kingdom, was extreamly troubled with them.</p>
               <p>In the ſame Sixteenth year, were taken at <hi>Maſs,</hi> in their ſeveral Houſes, the Lord <hi>Morley</hi>'s Lady, and her Children; the Lady <hi>Gilford,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Brown:</hi> Who being thereof Endicted, and Convicted, ſuffer'd the Penalties of the Laws.</p>
               <p>In her Twentieth year, the ſevere Laws againſt <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> were Enacted.</p>
               <p>In her Twenty third year, a Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was ſet forth, That whoſoever had any Children beyond Sea, ſhould by a certain day, call them home; and that no Perſon ſhould harbour any <hi>Seminary Prieſt,</hi> or <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit.</hi> At this time alſo there aroſe up in <hi>Holland</hi> a certain Sect, naming themſelves, <hi>The Family of Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a Parliament held the 26th. year of her Reign, the <hi>Puritan Party</hi> labour'd to have Laws made, in order to the deſtroying of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the ſetting up of their own Sect.</p>
               <p>In her Twenty eighth year, the Queen gave a ſpecial Charge to <hi>Whitgift,</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to ſettle an Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in the Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, which lay now almoſt a gaſping. And at this time,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103959:26"/>the Sect of <hi>Browniſts</hi> (deriv'd from one <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Brown</hi>) did much oppoſe the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In her One and Thirtieth year, the <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan-Flames</hi> broke forth again.</p>
               <p>In her Thirty ſixth year, the Severity of the Laws were Executed upon <hi>Henry Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi> and the Sectaries, for condemning, the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as no Chriſtian Church. <hi>Thus Sir</hi> Rich. Baker.</p>

                  <p>It's the Doctrine of the <hi>Reformation</hi> that we may with a ſafe Conſcience be to day <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> to morrow <hi>Lutherans,</hi> in <hi>France Hugonots,</hi> in <hi>Hungary Trinitarians,</hi> in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Socinarians;</hi> and in <hi>London</hi> of any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion but <hi>Popery;</hi> they allow to be Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to change Religion as Time and Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion require; this is the practice of the firſt <hi>Reformers.</hi> This Truth requires not much to juſtify it; be pleas'd only to conſider, how you came to Change the Antient Religion profeſs'd in the Kingdom for 1500 years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</p>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103959:29"/>is truly a Member of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, the Doctrine of the Reformation comes to be Scripture, as each Congregation, and Perſon of ſound Judgement among them, Interprets it. This being an uncontrouled truth, what Man of ever ſo ſound Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but may read to day. Scripture, as Interpreted by the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Church, and judging in his Conſcience that Interpretation and Doctrine to be true; conſequently he may with a ſafe Conſcience profeſs that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: Soon after he may meet <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Books, and charm'd with the admirable ſtrength of his reaſons and gloſſes upon Scripture, he may judge in his Conſcience, he is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd before <hi>Luther,</hi> and ſo may lawfully forſake <hi>Lutheraniſm</hi> for <hi>Calviniſm;</hi> then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain he hits upon Scripture as Interpreted by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Doctrine ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhes him with that decency of Ceremonies, that Majeſty of her Liturgy, that Harmony of her Hierarchy, he is convinc'd it's better than <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> and embraces it: Then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain he reads the Works of <hi>Arrius,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd by the energy of his Arguments and Texts of Scripture, may alter his judgement, and become an <hi>Arian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherein can you ſay does this Man tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs the Doctrine or Principles of the Reformation? Does he forſake the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, becauſe he forſakes <hi>Lutheraniſm</hi> for <hi>Calviniſm?</hi> No ſure; for <hi>Calviniſm</hi> is as much the Reformation as the other: Is
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103959:30"/>not <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> as much the Doctrine of the Reformation as <hi>Presbytery?</hi> though he changes therefore one for the other, he ſtill holds the Doctrine of the Reformation: Is not the Doctrine of the Reformation Scripture, and that not as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> only or <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret it, but as any Congregation, or Man of ſound judgement holds it? It is therefore evident, that according to the Doctrine and Principles of the Reformation, he may with a ſafe Conſcience change Religions, and be to day of one, to morrow of another, until he run over All. Point me out any Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation (the obſtinate Papiſts excepted,) that will dare ſay I cannot live with a ſafe Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in any other Congregation but in it ſelf, all other Congregations will laugh at it: Why then may not I lawfully forſake any Congregation, and paſs to another; and be in <hi>England</hi> a Proteſtant, in <hi>Germany</hi> a <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran,</hi> in <hi>Hungary</hi> a <hi>Trinitarian</hi> or <hi>Socinian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is againſt the grain of Mans reaſon, that we can with a ſafe Conſcience change Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; If you be a Proteſtant, and you judge it to be the true Religion, you are bound to ſtick to it, and never to change it.</p>
                  <p>If I diſcourſe with a Papiſt, I would not wonder he ſhould ſay it's againſt the grain of Mans reaſon to believe it lawful; but I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire that a Child of the Reformation, be he of what Congregation he will, ſhould be ſo ignorant of his principles, as to ſay a Man cannot change Religions when he pleaſes:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103959:30"/>Nor do I undertake to prove againſt the Papiſt, that this is lawful, but I undertake to prove it lawful againſt any Reformed Child, or force him to deny the Principles of the Reformation.</p>
                  <p>Is it againſt reaſon, that a Man may read to day Scripture, and the <hi>Lutherans</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation upon it, and like it very well; and that he ſhould in this caſe embrace that Religion? Is it againſt the grain of Mans reaſon that this ſame Man ſhould next Year afterwards hit upon <hi>Calvin</hi>'s works upon Scripture, and after better conſideration, think his Doctrine to ſurpaſs that of <hi>Luther;</hi> and could not he then (being obliged to chuſe the beſt,) forſake <hi>Lutheraniſm</hi> and ſtick to <hi>Calviniſm?</hi> And is it againſt Mans reaſon that he after this may meet other Books of <hi>Arians, Socinians,</hi> &amp;c. and do the like? Have not we many examples of this in our beſt and moſt renowned Reformers? Did not <hi>Ochinus that great Light</hi> (ſays <hi>B.

                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve the difference betwixt the Papiſts and us, if of a Papiſt you become of any other Congregation, the Popiſh Church Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate you, thou art lookt upon as an <hi>Heretick,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtate,</hi> a <hi>ſtray'd Sheep;</hi> they will not admit you to their Communion or Liturgy; nay, could they well avoid you, they would never admit you to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and why? becauſe they are fondly perſuaded their own is only true Rellgion, and all others to be Synagogues of Satan; and if any of us will become a Papiſt, he muſt ſirſt abjure his former profeſſion: But if of a Proteſtant, you ſhould become a Presbyterian, a Lutheran, Quaker, or of any other of our Societies, you are never looked upon to be a jot the worſe for it; we are not a whit ſcandalized at ſuch changes, which we daily ſee; and it is an unſpeakable bleſſing, with what Accord, Unity, and Charity, you may ſee at our Liturgy and Communion, the <hi>Proteſtant, Presbyterian Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt, Socinian</hi> and <hi>Hugonot,</hi> all praiſing the Lord in One Congregation in our Church
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103959:32"/>none bid out of the Church, none Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, no previous abjuration required of their former Tenets; and there's nothing more frequent among us than to go to the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Liturgy in the Morning, in the Evening to the <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> eſpecially if our Intereſt or Convenience requires it. Can there be a more convincing Proof that we eſteem it all alike what Religion and Tenets we profeſs? Let a <hi>Lutheran</hi> go to <hi>France;</hi> Alas! he will never ſtick to go to the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots</hi> meeting and Service; let a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> go to <hi>Germany,</hi> he will go as cheerfully to the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Church, as in <hi>England</hi> to the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant:</hi> Let a <hi>Hugonot</hi> or <hi>Presbyterian</hi> go to <hi>Hungary,</hi> or <hi>Poland,</hi> he is welcome to the <hi>Trinitarians,</hi> and <hi>Socinians;</hi> and when any of them returns home he will be as before.</p>
                  <p>Is this Doctrine by the Teſtimony of any of our Synods? Did any teach that we may with a ſafe Conſcience change our Religion.</p>
                  <p>Yes, I can produce one: The Synod of <hi>Charent on</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> held about the Year 1634. expreſly ſays, That for our Salvation it's all alike whether you be a <hi>Calviniſt, Lutheran,</hi> or of any other Congregation of the Reformed; becauſe, ſays this venerable Synod, <hi>they all agree in Fundamental Points, and the</hi> Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans <hi>have nothing of Superſtition or Idolatry in their manner of Divine Worſhip.</hi> Change then as often as you liſt; be a <hi>Lutheran,</hi> be a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> be an <hi>Anabaptiſt;</hi> by the mouth
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103959:32"/>of this Synod you are aſſur'd you'l never miſs to hitright. And I pray can any Synod of our times have more Authority in point of Doctrine then <hi>Luther</hi> our firſt <hi>Reformer,</hi> a man extraordinarily raiſed by God, (ſays the Synod of <hi>Charrenton,</hi>) and repleniſht with his ſpirit to repair the ruins of his Church,<note place="margin">In parva Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſ.

                  <p>What greater Authority has a Synod of <hi>England,</hi> to prove a <hi>Doctrine</hi> to be of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> than a Synod of <hi>France</hi> which I have produced? or than <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> our firſt <hi>Reformers,</hi> inſpired by God, to teach us the purity of the Goſpel?

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:103959:33"/>be ſo bold as to ſay they reed in this, what aſſurance can we have, that they erred not in the reſt? But ſince nothing will pleaſe you but a Synod of <hi>England,</hi> you ſhall have not one, but many. Can there be any Synod of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> of ſo great Authority as our wiſe and prudent Parliament? Read our Chronicles and you'l ſind that in a few years time, they changed and eſtabliſhed different Religions by publick Acts of Parliament: In <hi>Henry</hi> the VIIIs.

                  <p>And when ſo eminent <hi>Men</hi> had not ſaid it, <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Scripture</hi> convinces it; <hi>Reaſon,</hi> becauſe that our <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> being <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> as each Perſon of ſound judgement un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands it; many <hi>Women</hi> undoubtedly are of ſound judgement, and why ſhould not their Interpretation of <hi>Scripture</hi> paſs for the Doctrine of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> as well as that of our <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Miniſters? Scripture,</hi> becauſe we read, the <hi>Samariatan</hi> Woman was the firſt who preached the <hi>Meſſias</hi> to the City of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and Chriſt commanded <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi> to go to Preach his Reſurrection to his Diſciples; and we know by our Chronicles, that our glorious Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of bleſſed Memory, did not only govern the ſtate, but was a great Apoſtoleſs in Church affairs.</p>
                  <p>To what purpoſe then, have we <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Miniſters,</hi> who enjoy ſo vaſt Revenues, if any <hi>Man</hi> or <hi>Women</hi> can Preach and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the <hi>Sacraments</hi> as well as they?</p>
                  <p>You may believe Biſhops and Miniſters are very needful for the ſervice of the Church; for they being commonly learned witty Men, and having Wives, they come to inſtruct
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:103959:37"/>Wives ſo well, that the good <hi>Women</hi> come in a ſhort time to be as learned as their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and as nimble and quick in the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Miniſtery, as if they were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to exerciſe it; as ſome Authors of Credit relate unto us, that a Gentleman of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> writ to his friend in a Village, (about three Leagues diſtant from that City,) whoſe Inhabitants were for the moſt part of our <hi>Lutheran Reformation;</hi> the good Paſtor exhorted his Flock to prepare for <hi>Easter Communion,</hi> that none ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to come to the <hi>Holy Table,</hi> but ſhould firſt <hi>Confeſs</hi> and receive <hi>Abſolution</hi> of his Sins; <hi>Easter Holy days</hi> being come, ſuch a multitude flock'd to <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> that the <hi>Paſtor</hi> could not ſatisfie the Devotion of ſo great a Croud; he called his <hi>Wife</hi> to help him to hear <hi>Confeſſions,</hi> and to give them <hi>Abſolution,</hi> in which <hi>Miniſtery</hi> the good <hi>Lady</hi> did Labour with great ſatisfaction of the <hi>Penitents;</hi> but neither the <hi>Paſtor</hi> nor his vertuous <hi>Conſort</hi> being able to diſpatch ſo great a multitude, he called his Maid Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, who did work in the Holy Miniſtery with as much expedition as her Maſter. For after all, the Church of <hi>Scotland, France,</hi> and all <hi>England, (Proteſtants</hi> excepted,) will tell you that <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Miniſters</hi> are not needful, nay, that they are very prejudicial to the <hi>Reformation</hi> and <hi>State;</hi> To the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> becauſe this Hierarchy was the Biſhops Court, Surplices, Corner Caps, and

                  <p>It is the <hi>doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Reformation</hi> that you cannot, becauſe God has forbid it, add to, and take away from his Word.

                  <p>It is a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Errour, we ſay to believe that <hi>Pennance,</hi> or other penal Works of Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Almſdeeds or corporal Auſterities, can avail and help for the Remiſſion of our Sins, and ſatisfying Gods Juſtice: No, we ſay,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:103959:53"/>Penal Works ſerve for nothing, all is done by <hi>Repentance;</hi> that's to ſay, by ſorrow of Heart for having offended God. This is the Doctrine of <hi>Daneus, Willet, Junius</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> who ſay <hi>Francis, Dominick, Bernard, Anthony,</hi> and the reſt of the Popiſh <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Fryars</hi> are in Hell for their Auſterities and Penal Works for all that, you may very well believe; and it's the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> that <hi>Pennance</hi> and Penal Works do avail for the Remiſſion of our ſin, and are very profitable to the Soul; for, our <hi>Common-Prayer-Book</hi> in the <hi>Commination againſt ſinners,</hi> ſays thus, <hi>In the Primitive Church, there was a Godly Diſcipline, that at the beginning of Lent, ſuch as were notorious ſinners, were put to open Pennance, and puniſh'd in this World, that their Souls may be ſaved in the day of the Lord.</hi> And our <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> Books wiſhes that this Diſcipline were reſtored again; and ſurely it does not wiſh that <hi>Popery</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored; therefore it is no <hi>Popery</hi> to ſay that <hi>Pennance,</hi> or Penal Works, do ſatisfie for our ſins in this World, and avail to ſave us in the other.</p>
                  <p>I know many much miſlike our <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> Book, for theſe <hi>Popiſh</hi>-Tenets; but what do you ſay of the grand Errours of <hi>Popery?</hi> can a man be a true Child of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and yet believe the <hi>Popes Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy?</hi> deny the <hi>Kings Supremacy;</hi> believe <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> and <hi>Communion is one kind;</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Kings Supremacy</hi> is undoubtedly the Doctrine of the Reformation, becauſe it is judged by the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be of Scripture, yet only the <hi>Quakers, Presbyterians, Anabaptiſts,</hi> and other Congregations judge it is not of Scripture, but as Erroneous a Tenet as that of the <hi>Popes</hi> Supremacy; <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> 6. <hi>Amos,</hi> ſays, <hi>They were unadviſed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Blaſphemers, who raiſed King</hi> Henry <hi>the</hi> VIII. <hi>ſo far as to call him the head of the Church;</hi> but alſo that no Civil Magiſtrate can be the head of any particular Church, the Doctrine of the <hi>Centuriſts, cent. ſept.</hi> pag. 11. of <hi>Cartwright, Viret, Kemnitus,</hi> and many others; who doubts then but that in the principles and Doctrine of the Reformation, you may deny the Kings Supremacy, though the Church of <hi>England</hi> believes it.

The ſecond is, if the ſubſtance of <hi>Bread</hi> be
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:103959:54"/>in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> together with <hi>Chriſt's Body?

Art. 7.</q> 
                     <hi>The Miniſter muſt give the Bread in the Supper to them, who cannot drink the Cup, provided it be not for contempt.</hi> And the reaſon is becauſe there are many who cannot endure to taſt the Wine; wherefore it often happens among them, that ſome perſons do take the <hi>Bread</hi> alone.</p>
                  <p>Now you may admire the injuſtice of the Papiſts in condemning our <hi>Reformed Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> as <hi>Hereticks,</hi> whereas thoſe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets are believed by many of us, as well as them; and the groundleſs ſeverity of our Congregations in exclaming againſt that Doctrin; it being the Doctrin of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, whereas ſo many eminent men of our own, judge it to be of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>For to know certainly if a <hi>Doctrine</hi> be of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> you muſt try it by our <hi>Teſt</hi> or Rule of Faith, which is the written Word of God, and whatever any man of ſound judgement, of a ſincere and humble Heart judges to be contained in Scripture, or an indubitable conſequence out of it; that Man may believe that <hi>Doctrine,</hi> let all others judge of it as they liſt, and by ſo believing, will be a true Child of the Reformation;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:103959:55"/>wherefore, ſince that the Church of <hi>France,</hi> that of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Edward</hi> the VI<hi>'s.</hi> time, <hi>Luther, Melancthon, Grotius,</hi> and other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors do judge <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> Popes Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, and Communion in one kind to be the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Scripture; we muſt call it the Doctrine of the Reformation; and if you judge as they did, you may believe the <hi>Doctrin</hi> and be ſtill of the Reformation, as well as they.</p>

                     </note> we may, and it will be a pious Godly action to belive them, and make as many Acts of Parliament for them, as now we have againſt them.</p>
                  <p>This is an evident ſequel out of that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and whereas there is not one Tenet of all thoſe which I rehearſed, whether they concern <hi>Doctrin</hi> or Manners; but was judged by the Doctors, which I cited for it, to be the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Scripture; it follows unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, that there is not one Tenet of them but is the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Reformation:
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:103959:58"/>Therefore you muſt be forced to either of theſe two; either to ſay that our Rule of Faith, by which ſuch <hi>Doctrines</hi> are warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is naught, wicked and ſcandalous of all thoſe I rehearſed; you cannot deny, but that it was taught by the Author I quoted for it, and judged by him to be the <hi>Doctrin</hi> of Scripture. And if no <hi>Doctor</hi> hitherto had believed, you, or I, or ſome other perſon of ſound judgement, may judge it to be the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Scripture; either of both, then you muſt be conſtrained to grant. Or that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Reformation, is not what each perſon of ſound judgement underſtands to be the <hi>doctrine</hi> and ſenſe of Scripture, which is as much as to ſay, that our Rule of Faith muſt not be Scripture as we underſtand it, but that we muſt believe againſt our Judgement and Conſcience, what others ſay is the <hi>doctrine</hi> and ſenſe of Scripture: Or you muſt grant that all and each of thoſe Tenets I rehearſed, is the <hi>doctrine</hi> of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though you, or this or that Man may judge them to be blaſphemies and ſcandals.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs our Rule of Faith in the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is Scripture as each perſon under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands it; for all our Reformed Churches do gives us this Rule of Faith.</p>
                  <p>And in caſe the Church of <hi>England, France,</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> judge a <hi>doctrine</hi> to bo blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and againſt Scripture, and <hi>Luther,</hi> or <hi>Calvin,</hi> or I, or another, judge it is good <hi>doctrine</hi> and conformable to Scripture, to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:103959:58"/>which judgement muſt I ſtand? Muſt I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what I judge in my Conſcience to be Scripture, and not what others judge, if they judge the contrary? When <hi>Luther</hi> began the Reformation, did not almoſt all Chriſtians and the whole Church believe <hi>Purgatory</hi> and <hi>Prayers</hi> to <hi>Saints</hi> to be the <hi>doctrine</hi> of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? And did not he very commendably deny it againſt them all, becauſe he judged by Scripture it was not? Will a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> believe Epiſcopacy, becauſe the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſays it is the <hi>doctrine</hi> of Scripture? No, but deny it becauſe himſelf judges It is not.</p>
                  <p>For let a Man be ever ſo leared and Godly; if he gives an Interptetation of Scripture which is denied by all the Church, he muſt not be followed.</p>
                  <p>Since when is it commendable to conſtrain Mons Judgements to believe, not what each one thinks beſt, but what the Church thinks may be ſafely believed? Was this Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the beginning of our Reformation, when our bleſſed Reformers began to teach their private Judgements againſt the Church then eſtabliſh'd? If it was, then the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is to be commended, for perſecuting and Excommunicating our firſt Reformers; and if this was not, nor is not commendable in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> why is it commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the Church of <hi>England?</hi> This is a piece of <hi>Popery,</hi> whereof the Church of <hi>England</hi> is guilty, and for which all our Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are jealous of her.</p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:103959:59"/>
                  <p> I confeſs other Congregations will admit no ſuch Curb, or Bridle on their Judgements, but follow Scripture as they underſtood it; but the Church of <hi>England</hi> has a reverent regard for the ſenſe and Interpretation of it given by Primitive Ages, Fathers and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and that we prefer before the private Interpretations of particular Perſons.</p>
                  <p>The Senſe and Interpretation of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive <hi>Ages, Church</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the Interpretation of any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſon, or Congregation, and what think you of our whole Reformation, which allowes no other Rule of Faith, but <hi>Scripture as each perſon of ſound Judgement underſtands it?</hi> What ſay you of <hi>Luther, Calvin, Beza,</hi> and the reſt of our Reformers, who preferred their own private ſenſe and Interpretation of Scripture, before that of the whole Church? What ſay you to the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> who prefer their own ſenſe and Interpretation of the <hi>Bible</hi> before that of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> I grant, there ought to be a reſpect for the judgement and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Text, given by the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church</hi> and <hi>Fathers;</hi> but if a <hi>Doctor</hi> or a Man of ſound Judgement, repleniſht with Gods Spirit, read Scripture with an humble Heart, and pure Intention, and judges by it that Bigamy is lawful; that there is no Myſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery of three perſons is one divine Nature; or that Chriſt deſpaired on the Croſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Tho
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:103959:59"/>theſe <hi>doctrines</hi> be quite againſt the Judgments of <hi>Fathers, Church,</hi> and <hi>Councils,</hi> he may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, and be ſtill a true Reformed Child, becauſe he follows our Rule of Faith; if he muſt deny theſe Articles, becauſe others decry them; then he muſt go againſt his own Judgement and Conſcience, for to conform himſelf to them, and his Rule of Faith muſt not be Scripture as each Man of ſound judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment underſtands it; but as the <hi>Primitive Ages, Church,</hi> and <hi>Councils</hi> underſtand it; and this is <hi>Popery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is it not generally believed in our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and moſt ſtrongly proved of late, by that incomparable Wit and Pen-man <hi>Doctor Stillingfleet,</hi> that <hi>Popery</hi> has as much Idolatry as <hi>Paganiſm:</hi> Our Land therefore had in <hi>Paganiſm</hi> as good a Religion as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by <hi>Auſtin</hi> in <hi>Popery;</hi> does not this our noble Champion, and moſt of the <hi>Scribes</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> teach, That Popery is a <hi>ſaving Religion,</hi> that we may be ſaved in the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> if Popery, (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it be Idolatry as they ſay) by a ſaving Religion, how can they deny but that <hi>Paganiſm</hi> is alſo a ſaving Religion, what need therefore had our Fore-fathers to abandon <hi>Paganiſm?</hi> why was it not left in the Land?</p>
                  <p>If <hi>England</hi> had been as well informed of the merit of Paganiſm, when firſt <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> was Preached, it had never exchanged the one Idolatry for the other.</p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:103959:60"/>
                  <p> Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> in his <hi>Charge againſt the Church of</hi> Rome, pag. 40. and 41. ſays plainly, <hi>That the</hi> Pagans <hi>are charged with more than they are guilty of;</hi> pag, 7. ſays that <hi>Jupiter</hi> ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Pagans; <hi>was ſo far from being an Arch-devil, in the opinion of St.</hi> Paul, <hi>that he was the true God, Bleſſed for evermore:</hi> that the Pagans adored but one Supream and Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent God, which they called <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and which they did believe to be neither a Devil nor a Man, but a true, and the firſt and chiefeſt of the Gods; and that the reſt of the Gods which they adored, they looked upon them as <hi>Inferiour deities,</hi> and gave them no other Adoration.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> and other Reformed Writers prove convincingly; as to their Sentiment, that Paganiſm is no more Idolatry than Popery, and that Paganiſm having been baniſh'd out of our Land upon the falſe Information of our firſt Teachers, that it was an Adoration of Devils, or evil Spirits, and wicked debaucht Men, who by counterfeit Wonders, and Cheats, gained the peoples Adoration; ſince that Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet</hi> Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> and other Reformed Writers will make it out, thar the Pagans Adored no Devils, but <hi>One true, Omnipotent, Supream God, bleſſed for ever more,</hi> which they called <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and the reſt of the Gods as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Deities, as Papiſts do their Saints, and will prove that the Pagans were charged by the firſt D. Doctors of Chriſtanity, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:103959:60"/>by all our Anceſtors, with more than they are guilty of; why ſhould not Paganiſm be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored again to the Land, and heard to ſpeak for it ſelf, and Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> and his zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous companions be Licenc'd to plead for them, and for holy <hi>Jupiter,</hi> ſo foully miſ-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by Antiquity, as to be believed an Arch-Devil, whom Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> will prove to have been <hi>a true bleſſed God for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Paganiſm was ſo unjuſtly baniſh'd from our Nation, if what Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> ſays, be true, he is a learned, Religious, and diligent ſearcher into Scripture; the Ancient D. Drs. and Fathers of the Church reading Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, judged and taught, that <hi>Jupiter</hi> was a Devil, as well as the reſt of the Gods which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> Adored; Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> and other Reformed D. Doctors reading Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, judge he was no Devil, but <hi>the true God bleſſed for evermore;</hi> any Child of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation may believe either of both, and put <hi>Jupiter</hi> into our <hi>Litanies,</hi> as well as JESUS Chriſt, and offer Sacrifice to him as formerly our Anceſtors did; for whatever any Man of ſound judgement judges to be the Doctrine of Scripture, may be ſafely believed, and is the Doctrine of the Reformation.</p>

               <p>There are no Doctrines mentioned here, but what are contained in the Catechiſms of all <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> and that which they teach all Children, and which are very wide from thoſe Doctrines that <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Preachers report of them about Diſpenſations, with Allegiance, Oaths, and all other Tyes, how ſolemnly ſacred ſoever; all which are no leſs commonly than untruly ſuggeſted; for I ſhall demand of ſuch, by what Councils re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> ſuch Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations have been allowed, or from what Church Tradition ſuch pernicious Tenents have been handed, (I deſire of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to produce one) for if it be any point of Faith, it muſt have taken riſe either from the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of ſome Council received in the Church,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:103959:62"/>or of Univerſal Tradition, ſince whatever obliges all <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> muſt of neceſſity enter into their belief or practice at one of theſe two doors. And if theſe Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have been taught neither by Councils nor Traditions, it remains that <hi>Protestants</hi> have been gull'd by their Paſtors in receiving ſuch for <hi>Catholick doctrines;</hi> which are taught no where but in <hi>Proteſtant Books</hi> and <hi>Pulpits:</hi> For had ſuch <hi>Diſpenſations</hi> been the <hi>Doctrines</hi> or Practices of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> what folly had it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Magiſtrates to require Oaths of them, who hold themſelves under no obligation to them when they have taken them, and what madneſs had it appeared in <hi>Papiſts,</hi> to incur the Forfeiture heretofore of their lives, and late of their liberty and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, rather then <hi>take ſuch Oaths,</hi> with which (if they had adviſed with the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter) they might have diſpenſed at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p>Country-men, read your Chronicles, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe your Statutes and Records, review many of your Ancient Cuſtoms and Obſervances, look upon the Windows of the Churches, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the Names and Dedications of the ſame Chruches, of divers days of the year, of divers of your Colledges, upon the Croſſes every where erected; upon the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Monaſteries, Abbies, and other Religious Houſes, which heretofore flouriſhed in this Kingdom, and then ſuffer you ſelves to doubt, if you can, whether your noble

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, take notice, that theſe ancient, and moſt Learned <hi>Fathers</hi> were great Praiſers, Practiſers of Auſtere and Penitential Works, conſiſting in frequent Prayer, in much Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in ſevere Faſting, in hard Lodgings, in courſe and ſpare Dyet, in wearing of Hair-Cloath,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:103959:64"/>and the like; they lived ſingle lives, many of them beſtowed their Wealth upon the Poor, and other Pious Uſes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed voluntary Poverty, following therein the Counſel of Chriſt, given <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.21. and they not only allowed of, but alſo moſt highly extolled the obſerving of perpetual Chaſtity, and Virginity, preferring the ſame far above Matrimony. Were not theſe men then ſtrange <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, take notice, that theſe Ancient Worthies, even by the Confeſſion of all <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> were men of accute Wits, of excellent Learning: If then they had found in the <hi>Word of God</hi> (as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſay they find) that only <hi>Faith</hi> does juſtifie; that <hi>good Works</hi> are not <hi>Meritorious:</hi> That in Works of <hi>Grace</hi> men have not <hi>Free-will:</hi> That they are not able to keep the <hi>Commandments:</hi> That it is not in the power of man or woman to live perpetually Chaſte; that Virginity is not more pleaſing to God than <hi>Matrimony;</hi> that to give all to the Poor, to Faſt, Pray, and watch much, and to undergo other Auſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Mortifications of the Body, doth not profit and enrich the Soul; that there is no <hi>Purgatory,</hi> no <hi>Pennance</hi> to be done, no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to be made for Sin, no puniſhment to be inflicted upon the Faithful for them, after this Life.</p>
               <p>If, I ſay, the Ancient Fathers had found theſe, and the like <hi>Doctrines</hi> of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> (and why ſhould they not
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:103959:64"/>have found them there, if there they had been, they being ſo wiſe, ſo learned, and ſo induſtrious ſearchers of the Word of God, as they were?) If there, I ſay, they had found theſe things, and had believed them as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do, they would have lived as <hi>Proteſtants do;</hi> for why ſhould they not?</p>
               <p>If theſe pleaſing <hi>Doctrines,</hi> which are light and eaſie to fleſh and the blood, and the ſweet liberty of the new Goſpel, has as feelingly pierced, and as ſtrongly poſſeſſed the Hearts of thoſe Ancients, as it did, and doth the Breaſts and Bowels of <hi>Luther, Zuinglius, Bucer, Peter Martyr, Beza,</hi> and their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, the Teachers of the <hi>Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi> they would, without all doubt, with theſe, have preferred Pleaſures before <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;</hi> Feaſting, before <hi>Fasting;</hi> the delights of the Conjugal Life, before the <hi>continent</hi> and <hi>ſingle;</hi> and in a word, Riches, Honours, Pleaſures, before <hi>Labours and ſmart of a Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential and Mortified Life;</hi> before <hi>voluntary Poverty,</hi> and the <hi>vexing Attire</hi> of <hi>Hair-cloth,</hi> or elſe they had been mad; had they believed as moſt <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do, that ſuch exerciſes as theſe are needleſs, fruitleſs, yea, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Toys.</p>
               <p>But the truth is, that thoſe ancient and ſhining Lamps of Wiſdom and Sanctity, did not believe as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do, and therefore they liv'd not as they do, for they were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe inſtructed in the School of Chriſt; they read, and learned another Leſſon in his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Goſpel, even the ſame that <hi>Papists</hi> now
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:103959:65"/>do, and therefore they inſtituted their Lives, as they did; and were in very deed as much <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as the <hi>Pope</hi> and His <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Fryars</hi> now are, and no more, moſt certainly; unleſs we will have them to have been Sots and mad-men.</p>
               <p>Let not then, my noble and dear Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the miſ-reports of ſome of your Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, ſo far prevail with you, as to make you believe (the better to keep and quiet you in <hi>Proteſtantiſm,</hi>) that the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church</hi> were <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> For certainly, thoſe bleſſed Servants of Chriſt were as far from being <hi>Protestants,</hi> as the moſt zealous of your Teachers are from being <hi>Papists,</hi> yea, from being Monks or Fryars, and from lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their Lives as thoſe Ancients did. If then you truly prize the Learning and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> and <hi>Christianity,</hi> become of that Belief which their Lives and Practiſes do preach unto you. If you think them ſaved, be not ſo hardy as to ſeek a new way to Heaven; for the ſafety of your Souls, is of greater moment, than ſo to be expoſed to hazard, (being there can be but one ſaving Faith;) Eternal Glory is not eaſily to be ſet upon the Dice, when you may take ſecure way to it. Become then of the Communion of the Church, in which the <hi>Fathers</hi> lived and died, that therein ſeconding your belief with a vertuous Life, you may aſſuredly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to Everlaſting Happineſs, beſeeching God to proſper your Reading: Conſidering
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:103959:65"/>withal, That without <hi>Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, no Man can be Saved.</hi> This is not only the Belief of all, that wear and deſerve the Noble Title of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> but certain alſo out of the <hi>Word of God. Act.</hi> 4.12. <hi>There is not Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in any other; for neither is there any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Name under Heaven given to Men,</hi> (to wit, but the Name of Jeſus,) <hi>wherein we muſt be ſaved.</hi> Mark 16.16. <hi>But he that ſhall not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> (namely, the Goſpel and Religion of Chriſt,) <hi>ſhall be condemned.</hi> Heb. 11.6. <hi>Without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> Rom. 5.1. <hi>Being therefore juſtified by Faith, let us have Peace toward God, by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: By whom alſo we have acceſs, through Faith, to his Grace.</hi> This Ground then is certain, and cannot be denied by any Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>For my ſecond Ground I lay: That this <hi>Faith in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which by God's Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is of neceſſity required to Salvation; is not a meer <hi>Natural Faith,</hi> or <hi>Humane Credulity;</hi> which Men may have by their own natural Forces, without the help of God's ſpecial Grace; ſuch as is the Faith of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> of <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Turks;</hi> and ſuch indeed, as is the Faith of all <hi>Hereticks:</hi> But it is a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, and Supernatural thing, which Men acquire and attain to, by the ſpecial Aid of God, by the help of Divine Grace; and therefore this Faith is called, and truly is, <hi>The Gift of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ground is certain, firſt out of the Word of God, which clearly teacheth, That
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:103959:66"/>
                  <hi>ſaving Faith is the gift of God,</hi> Phil. 1.29. <hi>To you it is given for chriſt, not only to believe in him, but alſo to ſuffer for him.</hi> Eph. 2.8. <hi>By Grace you are ſaved through Faith, and that not of your ſelves, for it is the gift of God: Not of Works, that no man may glory.</hi> Joh. 6.44. <hi>No man can come unto me,</hi> (that is, believe in me; for our firſt ſtep toward Chriſt is Faith,) <hi>unleſs the Father that ſent me draw him.</hi> And Verſe 65. <hi>Therefore did I ſay to you, that no Man can come to me; unleſs it be given him of my Father.</hi> Joh 15.5. <hi>I am the Vine, you the Branches; he that abideth in me, and I in him, the ſame bringeth much fruit; for without me, you can do nothing.</hi> Namely, appertaining to Salvation; and therefore not believe, as is requiſite to Life Everlaſting, without the help of Chriſt, that is, of Divine Grace by Chriſt merited, and purchaſed for us. Theſe places are clear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This ground is ſtrongly proved by Reaſon: For the end of Man being to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy <hi>Supernatural Glory,</hi> that is the clear Viſion of God, in his bleſſed Kingdom: The means to obtain this high and divine End muſt be ſuitable to it, that is <hi>Divine,</hi> and <hi>Supernatural. For who will ſay, that Man of himſelf, and by his own forces, without the Aid and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Favour of God, is able to make himſelf fit, and proportionate, to be aſſociated to the <hi>Saints,</hi> to the <hi>Angels,</hi> to <hi>Christ,</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> in Eternal Glory? Who will ſay, that of himſelf, he is able to cleanſe his Soul from
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:103959:66"/>the ſtains and filth of Sin, and to put upon her a Wedding Garment, a Golden and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplendent Veſture, ſuitable to the Banquet and Banqueters of Heaven? The ſpecial Operation then of Divine Grace, muſt Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie and Embelliſh the Soul of Man, and Attire her in Holy and Divine Vertues, that ſo ſhe may be fit to be the Conſort of God, in the Fruition of his Eternal Glory. And ſo <hi>Faith,</hi> which is one of theſe Virtues, and the very Ground and Foundation of the reſt, muſt be <hi>Divine</hi> and Supernatural,</hi> and ſpring in Man, from the help of God's Grace; and be Adorned and Dignified by it, that ſo there may be a fit proportion betwixt the <hi>Root</hi> and the <hi>Tree,</hi> the <hi>Seed</hi> and the <hi>Fruit,</hi> the <hi>Egg</hi> and the <hi>Brid,</hi> a <hi>Chriſtian Life,</hi> and the <hi>Glory of Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whoſoever will deny this ground, muſt not only forſake the Doctrine of the Holy Scriptures, and go againſt the light of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but he muſt alſo fall into the <hi>Pelagian Hereſie,</hi> condemned by the <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> Twelve Hundred years ago. Which held, That the Goſpel of Chriſt, being propoſed by his <hi>Preachers,</hi> men of themſelves, without any further help of <hi>Divine Grace,</hi> are able to believe the ſame, and do all therein requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Life Everlaſting. Which proud fancy of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and eſpecially the <hi>Biſhops of Rome,</hi> by the invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble force of God's Word, did cruſh, confound, and beat to the ground.</p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:103959:67"/>
               <p> My third Ground is, That as God cannot be the Author of a <hi>Lye,</hi> of a <hi>falſe Doctrine,</hi> of a <hi>falſe Faith,</hi> of a <hi>falſe Religion:</hi> That is, of a <hi>Rligion</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> that is mixed with falſhood, and is partly true, and partly falſe: So he neither doth, neither can ſtir up, and draw Men by his ſpecial Grace, Aid, and Operation, to believe thoſe <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,</hi> or <hi>Doctrines</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> which are ſo mixed with Falſhood. This ſeems to be evident, even by the light of Reaſon; for as it is the proper work of the Devil, to mix <hi>Religions,</hi> and to pollute them with Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood: So it is his continual, and ſtudious endeavour, to ſtir up, and induce Men, (by propoſing ſome pleaſing and delectable thing or other,) to believe and embrace the ſame, that ſo he may deprive them of <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> which is the <hi>Gift of God,</hi> and bring them aſſuredly to Everlaſting Damnation. Neither. let any one be ſo ſimple, as to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, That the Devil is only the Author of thoſe Religions, which are wholly Falſe.</p>
               <p>For ſcarcely is there any <hi>Religion</hi> in the World, that doth teach no Truth at all. And therefore it is ſufficient, to prove a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> to be the work of the Devil, if there be any falſhood in it at all, at St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſeem to teach, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. where, foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the riſing of the <hi>Manichean Hereſie,</hi> which long did peſter the Chruch of God, he calls the Doctrine thereof, the <hi>Doctrine of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:103959:67"/>Devils:</hi> Notwithſtanding that thoſe <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> with ſome falſhoods, did teach many. Truths; even as all <hi>Hereticks</hi> do; who, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, are the Inſtruments of the Devil, to ſeduce and deſtroy Souls.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, whoſoever do culpably Believe, and follow <hi>Religions,</hi> or <hi>Doctrines</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> partly true, partly falſe, do never believe the ſame with <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> which is the <hi>Gift of God;</hi> though they eſteem the <hi>Religion</hi> which they follow, to be the beſt of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; yea, to be the pure Light of the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt:</hi> But their <hi>Faith</hi> is ever a meer <hi>Humane Credulity,</hi> ſuch as is the <hi>Faith</hi> of all Miſ-believers, which can never bring them to Eternal Happineſs, how laudably ſoever they live; becauſe without <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> that is, the <hi>Gift of God,</hi> no Man can be ſaved, according to the ſettled Ordination, and Providence of God; as I before have clearly ſhewed out of his Word.</p>
               <p>Out of this Doctrine, which is moſt true, doth appear, Firſt, The Reaſon of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of of Chriſt, deliver<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d <hi>Matt.</hi> 7. where he declares, That falſe <hi>Prophets,</hi> that is, falſe Expounders of the Word of God, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Faith,</hi> do deſtroy Souls, like as Wolves do deſtroy Sheep; and that it is as impoſſible, that their Followers ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, by their teaching, <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> and <hi>True Sanctity,</hi> as it is impoſſible, that Thorns
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:103959:68"/>ſhould bring out Grapes, or Thiſles, Figgs. The ſame Doctrine is taught by the Apoſtle; who affirms, That <hi>Hereticks</hi> are <hi>ſubverted,</hi> Tit. 3. And <hi>Subvert the Faith of others,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.18. That they <hi>make Shipwrak about Faith,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.19. That they <hi>depart from the Faith,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.1. That they are <hi>Reprobate about Faith,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.8. and the like. Which miſchief they fall into themſelves, and bring upon their followers, though they Err but in one <hi>Article of Faith,</hi> as <hi>Himenaeus</hi> and <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> did, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.18.</p>
               <p>But Note here, That the Apoſtle in the places cited, doth not mean, that <hi>Heretical Teachers,</hi> do ſo Subvert and Ruine the Faith of their Followers, that they leave them no Faith at all; but that they ſubvert their <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Faith,</hi> which is the <hi>Gift of God,</hi> wholly overthrowing that, though they leave them ſtore of Humane Faith; to which ſeduced people firmly ſticking, yea, ſometimes even to Fetters and Death, do reap thereby no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, but <hi>Temporal Commodities,</hi> and Vain glory, purchaſed with the Eternal loſs of their Souls.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Doth appear, out of the ſame Doctrine, the great Obligation that <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian People</hi> have, to keep themſelves within the Boſom of the True and <hi>Catholick Church of Chriſt:</hi> Becauſe that this Church, being <hi>continually aſſiſted by Chriſt himſelf,</hi> Matt. 28.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:103959:68"/>20. And taught <hi>all Truth by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> John 16.13. doth propoſe unto her followers, in her Doctrine of Faith, nothing buth Truth; whereby their <hi>Faith</hi> doth eaſily come to be <hi>Divine,</hi> and the <hi>Gift of God,</hi> his Havenly Grace Co-operating with them. It doth alſo appear, how deeply they are obliged to take heed of, and to ſhun, and avoid falſe Prophets; falſe and heretical Expounders of God's Word; which run of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, not being ſent, authroized, or allowed of, by the Ordinary Doctors, and Paſtors, of the Ever Viſible and <hi>Catholick Church of Chriſt:</hi> And how wary they ought to be, not to have itching Ears, after new Maſters, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3. Or greedily to hearken to their Novelties in Matters of Faith; which upon the reckoning, will be found to be no better than Fables, that is, than the Fictitious and Self-inventions of mens brains: Though theſe buſie Teachers palliate them with ſpecious terms, and bear their Hearers in Hand, That theſe their new devices, are the <hi>Pure Light of the Goſpel.</hi> For by forſaking the <hi>Doctrine of the Church,</hi> the Spiritual Mother and Miſtreſs of all Nations; and as the Apoſtle terms her, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. <hi>The pillar and Ground of Truth;</hi> and following ſuch <hi>New Teachers,</hi> they make ſhipwrack of their <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> and run themſelves aſſuredly upon the Rock of Perdition.</p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:103959:69"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It appears how dangerouſly thoſe are deceived, who think they have Faith enough to Salvation, if they believe thoſe Points of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> about which <hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> agree; eſteeming themſelves not obliged to believe any of thoſe Articles; about which the Learned of theſe two <hi>Religions</hi> do differ and contend. As though <hi>Chriſtian people</hi> were not obliged, under pain of Damnation, to <hi>beware of falſe Prophets,</hi> Matt. 7. <hi>To ſhun Heretical Teachers,</hi> Tit. 3. <hi>To obey their Lawful Prelates, and to be ſubject unto them,</hi> in matters of Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. <hi>To hear thoſe Teachers,</hi> whom Chriſt doth ſend, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. <hi>To hear and obey the Voice of his Church,</hi> if they will not be held to be in as ill caſe, as <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Ethnicks</hi> are, Matth. 18.</p>
               <p>Or as though they were not bound to know the right means, by which they are to be Juſtified, cleanſed from Sin, and Saved; to Believe rightly, and to <hi>Receive worthily, the great Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. Joh. 6. And as though they were not obliged, under the ſame Penalty, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and profeſs the True Goſpel, the <hi>True Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion of Chriſt;</hi> and to Serve, and Worſhip God rightly. Seeing thoſe which believe not his Goſpel, that is, the whole Sum of Divine Doctrine, taught by his Apoſtles, and by their Succeſſors, the Ordinary Doctors, and Paſtors of his Church, <hi>are to be Damned.</hi> Mark. 16, As thoſe alſo
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:103959:69"/>are, <hi>Which deny Chriſt before men.</hi> Matth. 10.33. Which Crime all commit, who deny themſelves to be of the <hi>True Religion,</hi> as is manifeſt by the Example of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who denying only, that he was a follower of Chriſt, and of his Company, was reputed to deny Chriſt; even as thoſe will be, who culpably profeſs a <hi>Falſe Religion.</hi> For ſuch by their very Fact, deny the True, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be of the Communion thereof, and of the Company, and Society of the True Followers, Diſciples and Servants of Chriſt, whereby, at his Judgement-ſeat, they will be reputed to have forſaken and denied him.</p>
               <p>But to open this Point a little more (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many, even of the better ſort, are brought thereby into no ſmall danger of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) this their conceit is not grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any clear Text of <hi>Gods Word,</hi> or upon the Authority of any <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nerring Church,</hi> but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon a Miſtake of their own; by which, out of one or two Truths, they infer a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious falſhood; upon which, while they truſt, they truſt to a broken ſtaff, which at their laſt Leap, will let them fall into the deep Ditch of Perdition, if before their Death they caſt it not away.</p>
               <p>Which preſumptuous diſcarding of Divine Verities, revealed by Chriſt to his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> for the direction of mankind to Eternal happineſs, and by them laid up in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of the <hi>Church,</hi> as a <hi>Sacred Depoſitum,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.20. under the ſure Cuſtody of the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:103959:70"/>Holy Ghoſt, is no leſs than High Treaſon againſt Chriſt our Saviour, in regard that it raiſes a moſt <hi>pernicious Rebellion</hi> in his Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Kingdom, bringing part thereof again under the Tyranny of the Devil. It fruſtrates the full Operation of his Paſſion, extinguiſhes the true and right Worſhip of God, deſpoils <hi>Chriſtian People</hi> of <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> and thereby of the true means of Salvation. It deprives the Saints of due Honour, defrauds the Faithful departed of neceſſary Relief. It robs Heaven of Souls, and inriches Hell with innumerable unwary, and moſt unhappy People For which reſpects, it is rightly ſtiled one of the greateſt Sins, and of the loudeſt crying Crimes that is.</p>
               <p>Note, That God cannot ſtir up, and draw men, by this his <hi>Heavenly Grace,</hi> to believe theſe Verities, unleſs they be propoſed to be believ'd without all mixture of falſhood; for if any falſhood be packt in among them, and propoſed with them for a <hi>Divine Truth,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by God, he cannot draw Men, by his Grace, to believe them thus mingled and prepoſed with <hi>Falſhood,</hi> as is manifeſt, becauſe he cannot induce men to believe any Falſhood at all. And therefore, whoſoever doth thruſt in, among ſome <hi>Divine Vereties,</hi> any falſe Doctrine, contrary to that which God hath revealed, propoſing the ſame to be believed as a Divine Truth, and therein ſtubbornly contradicting the <hi>Teaching of the Church,</hi> he debars God from co-operating with his
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:103959:70"/>Grace, and from drawing people to believe, with <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> the Doctrine ſo mixt and propoſed.</p>
               <p>It appears how juſt cauſe all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have to return with ſpeed to the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> in which they may aſſuredly be ſaved, even by the Judgement of the moſt Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among them, becauſe it is more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that the <hi>Protestant Profeſſion</hi> is not a <hi>ſaving Religion,</hi> in regard, that the <hi>Doctrine of Faith,</hi> which it imbraceth, is not, nor cannot be wholly true, but really and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is mixed with much Falſhood,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe in divers weighty <hi>Points of Faith,</hi> it directly contradicts the expreſs Word of God, as I before have ſhewed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe this <hi>Doctrine of Faith,</hi> is not directed by any ſure Rule of <hi>Faith,</hi> by any <hi>Infallible Interpreter</hi> of the Scriptures, by and Un-erring Judge of <hi>Controverſies,</hi> nor propoſed by any ſure and Infallible Propoſer.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are divided into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Branches</hi> or <hi>Sects,</hi> which greatly differ, and are contrary one to another, in divers weighty Points of Faith, as I have before Noted.</p>
               <p>And 4. Becauſe <hi>Proteſtants</hi> hold, that all Churches are ſubject to erring, yea, and have erred in their <hi>Doctrine of Faith.</hi> What aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance then have they, that theirs doth not err? none at all.</p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:103959:71"/>
               <p> The <hi>Religion</hi> of the <hi>True Meſſias,</hi> is not to be introduc'd amongſt the Nations of the Earth, or in one Year, or in one Age: But by degrees, and by the Labours and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Endeavours of many Ages: Becauſe the ſame is not to be brought in by Force, but by Fair Means: Not by the Souldiers Sword, but by the Teachers Word: Not by Violent Compulſion, but by Gentle Perſwaſion; ſuch as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Apoſtolical Teachers</hi> have ever us'd. <hi>Going,</hi> (ſaith our ſweet Saviour) <hi>Teach all Nations,</hi> Matth. 28. And therefore this muſt needs be a work of long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; the Nations of the Earth being ſo many as they are, ſo dispers'd over the whole World, and diſ-joyn'd one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by Mountains and Seas; ſo Barbarous, ſo Drench'd in Sin, inur'd to Carnal and Brutiſh Cuſtoms: And the Religion of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> being ſo Holy and Profound, as <hi>Gods Religion</hi> muſt be. Yea, this Divine Work, of notifying the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> to all the Nations of the Earth, and of Converting them, or at leaſt part of each of them to him, is to endure and laſt, even till the end of the World; as is manifeſt out of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours words, before alleadg'd out of the 24 of <hi>Matth.</hi> See the place, and weigh it well.</p>
               <p>The Nations of the Earth, I ſay, for above theſe twelve hundred years, have not been Bleſſed in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> by believing in him, for want of a <hi>True Religion,</hi> though very many of them,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:103959:71"/>within the ſpace of time, have been Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, by the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> by the Labours and Induſtry of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> both in <hi>Europe, Aſia, Africa,</hi> and the New-found World: Neither are they ever likely to be Bleſſed in Him: For if already he hath not taken order, to preſerve a True, Divine, and <hi>Pure Religion</hi> among them, to bring unto them the Promis'd Bleſſing, that is, to San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify, and Save them: He is never likely to do it. For he is not likely to be wiſer, or better, or more powerful hereafter, than he hath been heretofore: Neither is he likely to come into the World again, to found a new <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> and to eſtabliſh it better, than He did his firſt, for the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mankind.</p>
               <p>I demand of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> if the Church of Chriſt, hath err'd, as they ſay, in her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Faith, from whence proceeded this her erring? Did this happen, becauſe Chriſt could not keep her from erring; or becauſe he would not? If he could not, how is he God? How is he Omnipotent? How is it True, that he had <hi>All Power given him in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth,</hi> Mat. 28.18. If Chriſt could enable his Apoſtles, to Preach his Religion, over the World, without danger of erring, and of deluding the Nations of the Earth; why could not he alſo enable their Succeſſors, the Ordinary Doctors and Paſtors of his Church, to Teach and continue the ſame Religion, in all ſucceeding Ages, without
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:103959:72"/>danger of erring, and of miſleading his People? If God could direct men to write his <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> without danger of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; why can he not direct men, to expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the ſame <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> in all Ages, without danger of erring in matters of Faith?</p>
               <p>Well then, <hi>Proteſtants</hi> muſt, ſay, that Chriſt could have preſerv'd his Church, in all Ages, from danger of erring in her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Faith; but would not. But why would he not? Did the Increaſe of his own Credit and Glory, move him to this neglect, or the good of Mankind? not the Increaſe of his own Credit. For what Credit, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Glory, could acrew and riſe to him, by the erring of his Church? Doth this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his Workmanſhip, in Founding her? His Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Power in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her? I think not. Nay, could it become the Wiſdom of a Diſcreet man, to take ſo great Pains, and to ſuffer ſo Painful and Ignominious a Death, as Chriſt did, for the Founding of an Erring Church, which ſhould delude and miſlead the World? Would any <hi>Honeſt Proteſtant,</hi> if he had the like Power, that Chriſt had, have Founded ſo miſerable a Church, as they eſteem Chriſt to have Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? I believe not.</p>
               <p>Was it then, the good of Mankind, that invited Chriſt, to Conſtitute an erring Church? Truly no. For no good can come to men, by ſuch a Church; but rather much
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:103959:72"/>harm; yea, infinite miſchief. As endleſs Diſcord, Broils, Contentions; Bloody En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters, uncertainty in matters of Faith happen, as amongſt the Reformers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of all Religion; and the ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Infinite Souls. For the Devil would never go about to ſeduce the Church, and to Pollute her Doctrine, with Errours and Superſtitions, but to do Miſchief, and to bring Souls to Perdition.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, ſeeing that it could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound, either to the Glory of God, or the good of Men, that Chriſt ſhould Found an Erring Church; it is very groſs Errour, to hold that he did. And thoſe, who ſo think; do greatly miſtake, and exceedingly wrong the Wiſdom, and Goodneſs of our Saviour; as will more clearly appear in the enſuing Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>If it be true, that the Church of Chriſt, for ſo many Ages, hath Err'd in her Doctrine of Faith: Imbracing, as it were, with both her Arms, and inſtilling into her Followers, many Pernicious Errors, many groſs Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions: Notwithſtanding, that Chriſt her Spouſe and Saviour Promis'd, <hi>Matth. 16. That the Gates of Hell ſhould never prevail againſt her.</hi> That the Holy Ghoſt ſhould <hi>Abide with her Paſtors for ever, St.</hi> John <hi>cap.</hi> 14. and ſhould <hi>Teach them all Truth,</hi> Joh. 16. That he himſelf would be with them <hi>All days, even till the end of the World,</hi> Mat. 28. And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, that God Promis'd, that <hi>His
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:103959:73"/>Spirit and Word ſhould never depart from this Church,</hi> Iſaias 59. That ſhe ſhould <hi>Stand for ever,</hi> Daniel 2. And ſhould <hi>Never be Corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> Daniel 7. Being indeed the <hi>Pillar and ground of Truth,</hi> as the Apoſtle affirms, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. If I ſay, the Doctrine of <hi>Proteſtant Teachers,</hi> about the Erring of the Church of Chriſt, being ſo contrary to the Word of God as it is, be true.</p>
               <p>I demand of Prudent and Underſtanding <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> how it can be defended, that God is truly Good, hath a fatherly care of Men, doth truly love them, and tender their Spiritual good, and hath a true deſire of their Eternal Salvation: Seeing, that whereas he doth freely permit the Devil, to fill the World with falſe and wicked Religions, with Abominable and Deteſtable Worſhips, to bring Men aſſuredly to ever laſting Damma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: He himſelf (though he could moſt eaſily do it) doth not continue, maintain, and uphold in the World, in all Ages, ſo much as one True Religion, ſo much as one Holy and Divine Worſhip, to bring them to Salvation? No, not after that his Bleſſed Son made Man, by Infinite Humility, by Innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Labours undergone for his ſake, by ſhedding his moſt precious Blood, had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to appeaſe his Indignation, to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate his Wrath, and to gain and purchaſe Love and Mercy for them.</p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:103959:73"/>
               <p> What Chriſtian Breaſt, can believe ſo monſtrous a thing as this? Or who can Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſo baſe a Thought of the Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Sweetneſs and Mercy of God? Or how come Diſcreet and Underſtanding <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> to ſwallow ſo groſs an Abſurdity as this? If the Tenet of the <hi>Proteſtant Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,</hi> touching the Erring of the Church, be true; how is that true which Chriſt ſays, <hi>John.</hi> 3.16. <hi>That God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that every one that believeth in him, periſh not, but may have Life everlaſting. For God ſent not his Son to judge</hi> (that is to damn) <hi>the World; but that the World may be Sav'd by him:</hi> Or that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. <hi>God will have all men Sav'd, and come to the knowledge of the Truth?</hi> How I ſay are theſe Divine Aſſertions true, if to bring Men to Salvation, God doth not ever preſerve a True Religion in the World? Doth not ever uphold the Truth of his Goſpel?</p>
               <p>For by falſe Religions, no man can be Saved; in regard, that the Devil, and not God, is the Author and Suggeſtor of Falſe Religions, by which he intends the Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Men, and not their Salvation, as is manifeſt. Yea, he neither can, nor will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce men, to invent a Religion able and fit, to ſave men in. Mark this well, and alſo Note, that our Saviour, in the Sentence alleadg'd by the word <hi>World,</hi> doth not mean that only Age, in which He and his Apoſtles
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:103959:74"/>liv'd, nor thoſe men only, which then liv'd: But all following Ages, and all that were to live even till the day of Doom. All which, God would have to come to the knowledge of the Truth; namely, of his Divine Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: and to ſave them all, he ſent his bleſſed Son into the World. And therefore we muſt of neceſſity grant, that he provideth the People of all Ages, of a True and Viſible Church, by which they may be Sav'd: And that he ever preſerves in all Ages, the Truth of his Goſpel (of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks in the Sentence alleadg'd) that ſo men may come to the knowledge thereof.</p>
               <p>For if the true Goſpel of Chriſt, be not extant in all Ages, how hath God a true Will and Deſire, that the People of all Ages, ſhould come to the knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? Neither is it ſufficient, that it be extant in the <hi>BIBLE,</hi> for all to come to the knowledge thereof: For all cannot read the <hi>Bible;</hi> neither can thoſe which are skill'd in Reading, thence pick out the true Goſpel, without the help of a True <hi>Interpreter:</hi> But it muſt be ever extant in the Sums of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrine left in the Church with the Ordinary <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Pastors</hi> of the Church, whom others are bound to <hi>Hear and Obey,</hi> Luke 10. Heb. 13. And of whom they are to learn Divine Faith, which is gotten <hi>by Hearing,</hi> Rom. 10. which is clear out of <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. where Chriſt expreſly foretells, that his True Goſpel, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the ſame that
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:103959:74"/>he Taught, ſhould be <hi>Preached</hi> to all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, even till the end of the World: And therefore the True Goſpel muſt not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved only in the <hi>Bible,</hi> but be ever extant in the Preaching of the Church.</p>
               <p>Out of that which hath been ſpoken in thsi Dicourſe, who doth not ſee, that the Prime and Fundamental Article, of the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> doth not only extreamly Diſgrace the Wiſdom, Goodneſs and Mercy of God, and extenuate the Merits of Chriſt; but doth alſo tend to the Denial of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity: to the utter neglect of God: Yea, and to plain <hi>Atheiſm</hi> it ſelf? For who will think, that the Son of God, really Dy'd for Mankind, if he gain'd ſo little for them? Or that there is a God, that doth truly love Men, and tender their good, if he be ſo unmindful of them, and of their Eternal Happineſs and Salvation. The tending then of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> ſo much to the Diſgrace of Chriſt, and of God, doth clearly ſhew, who was the firſt Founder of it.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, as certain as it is, that there is a God, who is Infinitely Wiſe, Good and Merciful; and who doth truly love Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and tender their Eternal Good: And as certain as it is, that Chriſt the Son of God, Died for us, took a moſt provident courſe, for our Salvation; and that his Merits are of ineſtimable worth: So certain is it that God hath ever preſerv'd in the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:103959:75"/>World, a True, and viſible Church, in which Men may be Sav'd if they will. For Chriſt did rot <hi>Light up a Candle to put in under a Buſhel,</hi> Mat. 5. And ſo certain it is, that the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> which is Erected upon ſo bad a Foundation as the Erring of the Church is, is neither good, nor ſufficient to Salvation.</p>

               <p>TO make this appear more fully, I will give you a brief Relation of the paſt Proceedings of the Church, in the Deciſion of the Diſputes concerning the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> of Chriſt in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and in the <hi>Subſtantial Converſion</hi> of the <hi>Elements</hi> of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> into the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi>

               <p>This <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> and <hi>Subſtantial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion Berengarius,</hi> and ſome Followers of his long ago denied: Who being complained of, two <hi>Councils</hi> were called one after another, at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Verſeilis, Anno Domini</hi> 1050 <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rengarius</hi> Summoned, and he not appearing, his Heterodox Opinions were condemned. He(according to the new <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Grounds) thinking his a Doctrine of great conſequence, and the Decrees of the two <hi>Councils,</hi> a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Error; and that himſelf had manifeſt Scripture, and Demonſtration againſt it,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:103959:81"/>judged himſelf freed from the obedience of ſilence, or noncontradiction, of theſe Councils. And ſo he, and his Followers pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly juſtified his <hi>Tenet,</hi> deſiring a reverſion, by ſome new Council, of the former ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt it.</p>
               <p>Upon this revived Diſturbance of the <hi>Church,</hi> another Council, five years after, is Aſſembled at <hi>Tours, Anno</hi> 1055. not far diſtant from <hi>Angiers,</hi> where he was Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon. Here himſelf, with others of his Party, were preſent, his Cauſe pleaded, his Demonſtrations conſidered; and after all, his Opinion again condemned; himſelf alſo Recanting it.</p>
               <p>The Council diſmiſſed, he finds yet other new Reaſons, and a greater ſtrength in his former; and falls again to the abetting, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, and ſpreading abroad his old Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin. A Fourth Council upon theſe new Troubles of the Church, <hi>Anno</hi> 1059. Four years after the laſt, was called at <hi>Rome;</hi> where himſelf alſo was preſent. Some ſay, long Diſputation there had, his new Plea for it was found too light, and rejected: And his Opinion, oppoſing Subſtantial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, again condemned, both by himſelf and Council, conſiſting of an Hundred and Three Biſhops.</p>
               <p>The Third time this man revolts, and publiſhes a Writing, (anſwered by <hi>Lanfrank,</hi> afterwards Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he complains, That ſome particular Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:103959:82"/>of his ſwayed the former Council, and had made him to ſwear Contradictions.</p>
               <p>Theſe new Imputations occaſioned a Fifth Council to be called at <hi>Rome, Anno Domini</hi> 1078. in which were new Diſputings, his laſt Cavils cenſured, and the Article of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Converſion further vindicated; and his Error of the Subſtance of Bread remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, again condemned by this Council: And laſtly condemned by himſelf.</p>
               <p>Such was the Sentence of Five General Councils of the Weſt; and the ſame Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then refuted, yet are ſtill urged; as will appear by the Writers of thoſe times, <hi>(Lanfrank Guitmundus, Algerus,)</hi> to any one that pleaſeth to peruſe them: The ſame Authorites out of the Fathers then preſſed, as are ſtill produced a-new by the Reformed, and with the ſame Anſwers repelled. All theſe Councils (if ſome of them in the Members thereof, leſs numerous, yet) uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally accepted by all the Weſtern Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; where this Controverſie was only agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated: Not one ſingle Biſhop thereof (that is known) diſſenting, or ſiding with the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rengarians.</hi> Look we for more ſatisfaction yet?</p>
               <p>When the Fervor of parties, in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was much allay'd, and the Church had had ſufficient leiſure to conſider, and digeſt the former Conciliary Degrees, above an Hundred years after the laſt of the Councils afore-mentioned, the great <hi>Laterian</hi> Council
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:103959:82"/>was aſſembled, under <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third; in which were preſent the Patriarch of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in perſon, and the Subſtitutes of the Patriarch of <hi>Antioch;</hi> and of the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Patriarch (lying under the <hi>Saracen</hi> yoak) <hi>Germanus,</hi> his Deacon.</p>
               <p>['<hi>Tis true indeed, that ſome of theſe Partriarchs were then</hi> Latines <hi>or belonging to the</hi> Latine, <hi>or</hi> Weſtern <hi>Church; becauſe both</hi> Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>and</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>being held in Poſſeſſion (the one for near 60, the other for near 100 years) by the</hi> Latines; Latine <hi>Patriarchs were then E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected: As ſometimes</hi> Greeks <hi>alſo, by the Power of the Emperors, have been Biſhops of</hi> Rome.

               </p>
               <p>Two Hundred years after this, again, the Council at <hi>Florence</hi> declared likewiſe for the ſame, in the Articles of Inſtruction for the <hi>Jacobins,</hi> and <hi>Armenians,</hi> in theſe Words, <hi>By force of the Words of Chriſt; the Subſtance of Bread is converted</hi> (or changed) <hi>into the</hi> Body of Chriſt; <hi>and the</hi> Subſtance <hi>of</hi> Wine <hi>into his</hi> Blood.</p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:103959:83"/>
               <p> Now if the Decrees of ſo many <hi>Councils,</hi> ſo often weighing the Adverſaries Reaſons, and Evidences, was not ſufficient for ſettling ſuch a Point, what can hereaffter be ſufficient! Or how can we ever hope, that any Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie ſhall be finally determined, or ended, by any future <hi>Council!</hi> Can there be any ground here, to queſtion the integrity, or lawful proceedings of ſo many Councils, at ſuch a diſtance from one another?

Or can there be any <hi>New Light</hi> in this Point, (ſince there are no <hi>New Revelations</hi>) attainable in theſe preſent times, which thoſe were never capable of?

               <p>Can any deſire a fairer Judicature by <hi>Councils,</hi> in any matter than there has been already in this? And is there any reaſon, that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſhould refer themſelves in this Point (as they do) to the judgment of a new <hi>Council?</hi> If all the <hi>Councils</hi> ſucceſſively erred in this Point, ſo manifeſtly, as that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:103959:83"/>they could not lawfully oblige their Subjects to obedience, the next, and the next to that, of ſuch <hi>Councils</hi> as ever we can hope for, may Err ſo too, and the ſame Obedience be denied to them; whilſt one pretended Evidence, or Demonſtration, quelled, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther new one ſtarts up, and demands ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
               <p>But if theſe Councils be invalid, or not ſufficient for the eſtabliſhing the belief of a Subſtantial Converſion, let us ſee the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Reformation here, to repeal their <hi>Acts,</hi> and to eſtabliſh the contrary to them.</p>
               <p>After all theſe Councils fore-named, and that of <hi>Trent</hi> added to them, <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1562. a Synod is called at <hi>London,</hi> of Two Provinces only of the Weſt, conſiſting of about Twenty four Biſhops, and Two Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans: And by Theſe, againſt all the former Councils above-ſaid, it is Decreed, (<hi>Articulo</hi> 28.) <q>That the change of the Bread and Wine in the Euchariſt, is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws the nature of a Sacrament.</q>

               <p>Now, in obedience to this their Decree, they tie their Subjects to ſubſcribe, that <hi>they acknowledge it</hi> (that is, believe it) <q>to be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Word of God.</q> [See their Synod 1603. <hi>Can.</hi> 63.] This is an Obedience, which themſelves (though Subjects) to deny to the Decrees of all thoſe precedent Councils;
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:103959:84"/>wherein the judgments of all the Biſhops and Metropolitans of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> World then concurred; and amongſt the reſt, Thoſe of theſe Two Provinces alſo: And yet doth their Synod require it.</p>
               <p>Here let a Sober Chriſtian judge, if Aſſent be held due to this <hi>London-Synod,</hi> is it not to thoſe others much rather? To thoſe others, I ſay, incomparably more numerous, accepted by the <hi>Weſt</hi> for many Ages, and adher'd to ſtill by the greateſt part thereof: Having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them the Scriptures, and the Traditive Expoſition of them; weighing the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that are ſtill on foot; meeting ſo often, and ſo concluding ſtill in the ſame judgment.</p>
               <p>But if thoſe other Councils are juſtified, by the Practice of this <hi>Englisſh Synod,</hi> in their requiring Aſſent, and Obedience, then is the Reformation rendred unlawful; as likewiſe their <hi>Appeal</hi> to future <hi>Councils;</hi> which can afford us no more juſt ſatisfaction, than the fore-paſs'd.</p>
               <p>Here you have ſeen, that for the Deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this Controverſie, a General Council (that is, the moſt General that the Times would permit) was aſſembled in the <hi>Weſt;</hi> nay, of Theſe more than One, as has been ſhewed: A <q>Subſtantial Converſion of the <hi>Elements,</hi> and <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> declared to be the ſenſe of thoſe Scriptures, and a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ſuitable required in this great Myſtery:</q> Not one Biſhop in theſe <hi>Councils</hi> (for any
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:103959:84"/>thing we know) Deſſenting; and Thoſe of the <hi>Eaſtern Churches</hi> abſent, conſenting in the ſame judgement. What more can be done? Ought not <hi>Senſe, Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,</hi> here, be ſilenced? and ought not ſuch a Decree rather be aſſented to, than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Decree of the forementioned Synod called at <hi>London?</hi>

               <p>
                  <q>Now for a further <hi>Confirmation</hi> of This Doctrine, I will here deliver Evident Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of moſt Eminent Fathers, and Doctors of the <hi>Church,</hi> concerning it.</q>

               <p>MAny of the <hi>Holy Fathers</hi> have taught, That the <hi>Faithful</hi> partake of the <hi>Body and Blood of Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> not with a mental mouth by <hi>Faith</hi> only, as <hi>Calvin</hi> would have it, but even with a Bodily Mouth in the way of a true and proper Eating: So St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin l.</hi> 2. <hi>contra Adverſarium legis &amp; Prophetarum c.</hi> 9. <q>We receive with a faithful heart and mouth <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> giving us his Fleſh to eat, and his Blood to drink;</q> and St. <hi>Leo, Serm.</hi> 6. <hi>de jejunio menſis ſeptimi,</hi> where he Writes thus, <q>We ought ſo to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate at the holy <hi>Table,</hi> as that there be no doubt of the truth of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Body,</hi> for the ſame is taken with the Mouth, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved with the Heart.</q>

               <p>Many more <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> of the <hi>Holy Fathers</hi> are yet behind, which to produce were eaſy, if there were no pains in Tranſcribing them; and thoſe already produced are ſufficient for the truth of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and for the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> of the <hi>Body of Chriſt</hi> there.</p>
               <p>Jo. 6. <hi>v.</hi> 54. <hi>Who Eates my Fleſh, and Drinks my Blood, hath Eternal Life, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi> And the <hi>Council of Nice</hi> calls the <hi>Euchariſt Symbolum Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis, a token of the Reſurrection;</hi> and St. <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius M.

               <p>Now if you ask the manner how it ſerves, as an incorruptible food for a Glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, The Species being altered by the heat of the Stomach, the Body of Chriſt ceaſes to be here, but his Deity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains after a ſpecial manner in the Soul, (as the virtue of Wheat remains in the corrupted grain, to raiſe it again at Spring) feeding
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:103959:87"/>it with Grace, and at ſet times affording it new infuſions of Actual Grace, Divine Lights and Heavenly Affection; and in the Reſurrection raiſes again the Body, and unites it to the Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reformers</hi> Object, that the ſame Body of Chriſt cannot be multiplied ſo often over. We anſwer out of <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.21. <hi>Our Lord God caſt a dead ſleep upon</hi> Adam, <hi>and when he was faſt aſleep, he took one of his Ribs, and filled up fleſh for it, and our Lord God built the Rib which he took of</hi> Adam <hi>into a Woman.</hi> I ask how many times over muſt this Rib be multiplied, before a whole Woman (of a comely proper Stature) could be made of it: After the ſame manner, God can of one ordinary Brick make a Pillar of many Foot high, by Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying that one Brick; in the like manner, our Saviour Multiplied thoſe five Barley Loves with which he fed above five Thouſand Men. <hi>Jo. 6.</hi> For if he made new Loves, he did not feed them with thoſe five; but with thoſe many hundred new Loves which he made; and yet the <hi>Scipture</hi> ſaith <hi>v.</hi> 12.13. <hi>After they were filled, they gathered the Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and filled Twelve Baskets with the frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the five Barley Loves;</hi> and not of any new Loves created by Chriſt: So that the Bread which was eaten remained ſtill to be eaten; and it is worth our noting, that our Saviour did this Miracle, immediately before he did firſt declare this ſtrange Doctrine of giving his fleſh to be eaten like bread by
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:103959:88"/>every one; that ſo, when he ſhould have no reaſon to disbelieve the poſſibility thereof: For his Diſciples ſeeing that he had done that Prodigious Miracle: So very lately, ought not preſently to have ſaid, <hi>This is hard, and who can hear it?</hi> Neither ought they ſo ſoon to have walked a-part from him, as there St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <q>They did; but rather they ought to have ſaid with St. <hi>Peter,</hi> We believe and know thou art the Son of God, able to make thy words good, as thou wert able ſo to multiply ſo few Loaves.</q>

               <p>WE ſay theſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> prove clearly the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> of Chriſt's Body in the <hi>Hoſt.</hi> Becauſe they ought to be taken in their proper ſenſe, in which they would prove it clearly by the grant of our adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, who therefore ſay, they are to be taken <hi>Figuratively.</hi> Now that they ought to be taken here in their proper ſenſe, I prove <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> poſitively.</p>
               <p>Poſitive Proofs.</p>
               <p n="1">WHen in a Speech a word is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of it ſellf, to be taken in the literal or figurative ſenſe, you muſt look to the words that follow in the ſame Speech; if they expreſs the property of a figure, the word is to be taken figuratively; if the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the real thing, then the word is to be taken in the literal ſenſe.</p>
               <p>For Example, when one tells me <hi>I have ſeen the King,</hi> I know not yet what he means; whether his perſon or picture; but when he
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:103959:89"/>adds, <hi>ſet in a frame of Gold,</hi> I know he means his Picture, becauſe 'tis the property of a Picture to be ſet in a Frame. If he adds, <hi>ſpeaking with the Chancellour,</hi> I know he means the King's Perſon, becauſe 'tis the property of a perſon to ſpeak with another. Juſt ſo, when Chriſt ſays, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. <hi>v.</hi> 19 <hi>This is my Body:</hi> I know not yet what he means, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Real Body, or only a figure of it. But when he adds, <hi>which is given for you,</hi> I know he means of his true Body, becauſe 'tis the property of a true body to be ſacrificed for us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I prove again, that theſe words of Chriſt, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> are to be taken in the literal ſenſe, by the Proteſtant Principle, which is this. When two paſſages relate to, or ſpeak of the ſame matter in Scripture, the obſcurer paſſage is to be explained by the clearer.</p>
               <p>But theſe two paſſages relating to our Lord's Supper, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> and, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me;</hi> This latter is the obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curer, and that former the clearer; then this latter ought to be explained by that former, that is to ſay, to the ſenſe of that former, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt having changed a piece of bread into his Body by his Almighty word, ſays there to his Diſciples, <hi>Do ye for the food of other Souls, what ye have ſeen me do for the food of yours:</hi> Change ye likewiſe, by pronouncing the words I have ordained for that end, bread into my Body: but do
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:103959:89"/>it with ſuch circumſtances that people ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by may be mindful of my death and paſſion.</p>
               <p>But the clear Propoſition ought not to be explained by the obſcure one, thus: <hi>This is my Body,</hi> that is to ſay, this is a figure only or a remembrance of my body, becauſe he ſaid after <hi>do this in remembrance of me;</hi> for the thing was now done, and he told them what it was in clear words, afore he ſaid, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me;</hi> He did not ſay, <hi>this is a remembrance of me;</hi> no, but <hi>Do this in remembrance of me;</hi> He did not ſpeak of the ſubſtance of the thing, but only of the manner of doing it. By theſe words then <hi>in remembrance of me,</hi> he only intimated, that they ſhould make at that ſame time a ſenſible expreſſion of his paſſion to the people, as is ſeen done in the Sacrifice of the <hi>Maſs.</hi> If by, <hi>This,</hi> he underſtood a figure or remembrance, then he had ſaid, do or make aremembrance of me in remembrance of me, or remember me to remember me, which is ridiculous.</p>
               <p>Now, let any indifferent and judicious man be judge, if theſe words <hi>do this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me,</hi> be as clear to prove, that in the <hi>Euchrariſt</hi> or the Lord's Supper is only a Figure of Chriſt's Body; as theſe words <hi>This is my Body,</hi> are clear to prove, that the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is his true Body.</p>
               <p>If you inſtance, that as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> ſo he ſaid alſo <hi>I am a Vine,</hi> and conſequently, as the latter Propoſition muſt
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:103959:90"/>be taken figuratively, ſo muſt alſo the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. <hi>I anſwer,</hi> it doth not follow, there being a great diſparity. For we all, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> as well as <hi>Catholicks,</hi> avow that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions in the Holy Scripture cannot be taken in the literal ſenſe, if ſo taken, they imply or intimate ſomething contrary to Faith, as this Propoſition <hi>I am a Vine</hi> literally taken would do. Por <hi>Proteſtants</hi> as well as <hi>Catholicks,</hi> believe that the <hi>Divine Word</hi> hath aſſumed no nature but that of Man; then he hath not aſſumed that of a Vine and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently 'tis againſt Faith to ſay in the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſenſe, <hi>Christ is a Vine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But theſe words <hi>This is my Body,</hi> taken in the literal ſenſe, imply nothing againſt Faith; no more than he, who ſhewing you a knife, ſays, <hi>This is a Knife;</hi> for the term <hi>This,</hi> and the term <hi>Knife,</hi> ſuppoſe for the ſame thing, and not for different natures; ſo in Chriſt's Propoſition, <hi>This is my Body, This,</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> ſuppoſe for the ſame thing, not <hi>This</hi> for <hi>Bread,</hi> but for <hi>The Body of Chriſt;</hi> as well as the word <hi>Body</hi> ſuppoſes for it; though in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent way of ſignifying, <hi>This</hi> obſcurely, and <hi>Body</hi> clearly and diſtinctly.</p>
               <p>Here I humbly intreat the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Reader to reflect, that in the myſteries of Religion we muſt captivate our underſtanding, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. (that is to ſay; ſuſpend it from aſſerting what it might judge, had he nothing to rely upon, but the ſole relation of our ſenſes) to obey Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:103959:90"/>
               <p> God will have, as an homage due to him and his veracity, this proud faculty of man, which is earneſt to judge of all, ſubmit to his word. The aſſent of my underſtanding, by which I judge a thing to be, becauſe I ſee it with my eyes, is an aſſent of ſcience, which is a knowledge quite different from the aſſent of Faith. In the mean time, we Chriſtians, as Chriſtians are called, not Philoſophers the Reaſoners, but the Faithful. <hi>Fides eſt,</hi> as we ſay, <hi>credere quod non vides, Faith is to believe that which thou doſt not ſee. This is the praiſe of Faith,</hi> ſaith St. Aug. tract. 29. in lo. <hi>If that, which is believed, be not ſeen. Bleſſed are they, ſaid Chriſt</hi> Jo. 20. <hi>v.</hi> 29. <hi>who have not ſeen and have believed. Faith is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (or perſuaſion) ſaith St.</hi> Paul, <hi>of things not appearing.</hi> If they appear, and I aſſent that they are, becauſe I ſee them, my Faith ceaſes, Science coming in with Faith's Deſtruction.</p>
               <p>If you ſay, I belive that the Son of God became Man, becauſe God hath revealed it, and my ſenſes do not controul it; your Faith is lame, and not able to ſtand alone, and conſequently is an unworthy Sacrifice of your underſtanding to the word of God.</p>
               <p>What would the King ſay to that Noble man, who ſhould diſtruſt his relation made in preſence of all his Courtiers, of a thing done by his Majeſty upon his Royal word; who ſhould (I ſay) diſtruſt it, becauſe he
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:103959:91"/>heard it controuled by a Foot-boy, or ſome ſuch mean perſon of as little credit?</p>
               <p>As humane Faith requires, I rely upon the ſole teſtimony of a man, ſo does divine Faith require I rely upon the ſole Teſtimony of God; ſhall I truſt the word of a man ſometimes contrary to ſenſible appearance, as when I truſt upon the word of a Doctor or a Chirurgion, that that which I feel hurts me, will do me good, and ſhall not I truſt the Word of God, becauſe my Senſes ſeem to controul it?</p>
               <p>But be not miſtaken, neither ſenſe nor reaſon controuls the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> of Chriſt's Body in the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> For, ſenſe after the Conſecration, finds its whole Object, Colour, Taſte, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Juſt as before the Conſecration unchanged, and meddles not to judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Body of Chriſt, or the ſubſtance of Bread, be under the Accidents, as a thing belonging to the underſtanding, and not within the compaſs of its Object. And Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon tells us, that although all the accidents of a ſubſtance be preſent, nevertheleſs their ſubſtance is not there, if the Author of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has not revealed that he hinders its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to them; and therefore does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul our ſaying, that the ſubſtance of Bread is hot in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> after the Conſecration, becauſe the Author of Nature hath revealed the contrary. No more then it controuls <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> ſaying, that thoſe three, who appeared to <hi>Ahraham Geneſ.</hi> 18. with all the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:103959:91"/>accidents of Men, were not Men but Angels, becauſe God has revealed it was ſo.</p>
               <p n="3">3.
